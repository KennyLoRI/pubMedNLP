    "### Observations\n",
    "1. The following dataset is composed of question answer pairs formed by humans using the dataset of PubMed articles involving the topic \"Intelligence\". In total, there are 40 questions and answers, covering 20 different types of questions for extensive evaluation. \n",
    "2. The prompt template used was: \"Be as short as possible in your answer. As an AI assistant, answer the question accurately, precisely and concisely. Use the following context: \n",
    "    {context}\n",
    "    Question: {question}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No matter the question, due to the nature of using a vector based database, there is always a set of documents retrieved based on the query. As a result, the model tends to answer questions that are not related to the topic, ie PubMed here too. \n",
    "4. On extremely, precise queries like giving a list of authors of a specific paper from the PubMed dataset, the model takes a long time for retrieving the top k documents, and will throw an error in retrieving the documents. \n",
    "5. The model scores very well on BERTScore with a Precision average of 0.798, Recall average of 0.809 and an F1 average 0.803 for all the questions answered. "
