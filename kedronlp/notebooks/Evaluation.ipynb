    "1. The following dataset is composed of question answer pairs formed by humans using the dataset of PubMed articles involving the topic \"Intelligence\". In total, there are 40 questions and answers, covering 20 different types of questions for extensive evaluation. \n",
    "2. The prompt template used was: \"Be as short as possible in your answer. As an AI assistant, answer the question accurately, precisely and concisely. Use the following context: \n",
    "    {context}\n",
    "    Question: {question}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No matter the question, due to the nature of using a vector based database, there is always a set of documents retrieved based on the query. As a result, the model tends to answer questions that are not related to the topic, ie PubMed here too. \n",
    "4. On extremely, precise queries like giving a list of authors of a specific paper from the PubMed dataset, the model takes a long time for retrieving the top k documents, and will throw an error in retrieving the documents. \n",
    "5. The model scores very well on BERTScore with a Precision average of 0.798, Recall average of 0.809 and an F1 average 0.803 for all the questions answered. "

The expected 5G-increased performance spanning across different indicators, flexibility to tailor the network to the needs of specific use cases, and the inherent security that offers guarantees both in terms of performance and data isolation have triggered the emergence of the concept of public network integrated non-public network (PNI-NPN) 5G networks. These networks might be a flexible alternative for the well-known (albeit mostly proprietary) Ethernet wired connections and protocols commonly used in the industry setting. With that in mind, this paper presents a practical implementation of IIoT over 5G composed of different infrastructure and application components. From the infrastructure perspective, the implementation includes a 5G Internet of things (IoT) end device that collects sensing data from shop floor assets and the surrounding environment and makes these data available over an industrial 5G Network. Application-wise, the implementation includes an intelligent assistant that consumes such data to generate valuable insights that allow for the sustainable operation of assets. These components have been tested and validated in a real shop floor environment at Bosch Termotecnologia (Bosch TT). Results show the potential of 5G as an enhancer of IIoT towards smarter, more sustainable, green, and environmentally friendly factories.\",\n",

We assess the whole ALPR pipeline, starting from vehicle detection to the LP recognition stage, including a vehicle classifier for emergency vehicles and heavy trucks. We used YOLO v2 in the initial stage of the pipeline and remaining stages are based on the state-of-the-art YOLO v4 detector with various data augmentation and generation techniques to obtain LP recognition accuracy on par with current proposed methods. To evaluate our approach, we used five public datasets from different regions, and we achieved an average recognition accuracy of 90.3% while maintaining an acceptable frames per second (FPS) on a low-end GPU.\",\n",

    "        \"Cephalopods, such as octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish, have evolved intelligence that is far beyond that of other mollusks. This is likely due to their complex nervous system, which allows for rapid processing of sensory information and the ability to learn and adapt quickly. Additionally, cephalopods have a highly developed sense of sight, smell, and taste, which helps them navigate their environment and find food. Their intelligence has also allowed them to develop complex social structures and communicate with each other in sophisticated ways. Overall, the evolution of intelligence in cephalopods is likely a result of their need to survive in a challenging and dynamic marine environment.'\",\n",
    "        \"Intelligence is not directly linked to happiness, but rather to the ability to navigate complex situations effectively. Intelligent individuals are better able to anticipate and adapt to changing circumstances, which can lead to greater stability in their emotional lives. Additionally, intelligence can help people to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, leading to increased resilience and well-being. While intelligence is not a direct cause of happiness, it can contribute to an individual's overall ability to cope with life's challenges and maintain emotional stability.\",\n",

Adequate nutrition and hydration are essential for maintaining cognitive function, and a well-designed diet can help support brain health throughout life. Research has shown that certain nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and antioxidants, play a critical role in maintaining cognitive function and may help reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline. A diet rich in these nutrients could potentially slow or even reverse cognitive decline in older adults, leading to better brain health and improved quality of life.\",\n",

    "        \"The main causes of international differences in student assessment and psychometric IQ test results are: cultural background, socio-economic status, access to education, teacher training, curriculum design, and testing methods. Cultural background refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular society or group that can influence how students perform on assessments and IQ tests. Socio-economic status refers to a person's position within their social hierarchy, which can affect their access to resources such as education and healthcare. Access to education refers to the availability and quality of educational opportunities available to students, including the availability of schools, teachers, and materials. Teacher training refers to the level of professional development and support provided to teachers, which can impact their ability to teach effectively. Curriculum design refers to the content and structure of educational programs, which can influence what students learn and how they are assessed. Testing methods refer to the specific techniques used to administer and score assessments and IQ tests, including the types of questions asked and the scoring criteria used.\",\n",

It is important to respect the autonomy and dignity of all individuals, including those with intellectual disabilities or other cognitive differences. Instead of focusing on ways to manipulate or control others, we should strive to create a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and equal opportunities for all.\",\n",
