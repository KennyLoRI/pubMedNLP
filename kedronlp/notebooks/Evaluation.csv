In domain questions,What are the predictors of nurses' attitudes towards communication?,"Empathy and emotional intelligence are predictors of nurses' attitudes towards communication, and the cognitive dimension of attitude is a good predictor of the behavioural dimension of attitudes towards communication of nurses in both regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis.","Aims and objectives: To analyse link between empathy and emotional intelligence as a predictor of nurses' attitudes towards communication while comparing the contribution of emotional aspects and attitudinal elements on potential behaviour.

Background: Nurses' attitudes towards communication, empathy and emotional intelligence are key skills for nurses involved in patient care. There are currently no studies analysing this link, and its investigation is needed because attitudes may influence communication behaviours.

Design: Correlational study.

Method: To attain this goal, self-reported instruments (attitudes towards communication of nurses, trait emotional intelligence (Trait Emotional Meta-Mood Scale) and Jefferson Scale of Nursing Empathy (Jefferson Scale Nursing Empathy) were collected from 460 nurses between September 2015-February 2016. Two different analytical methodologies were used: traditional regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis models.

Results: The results of the regression model suggest that cognitive dimensions of attitude are a significant and positive predictor of the behavioural dimension. The perspective-taking dimension of empathy and the emotional-clarity dimension of emotional intelligence were significant positive predictors of the dimensions of attitudes towards communication, except for the affective dimension (for which the association was negative). The results of the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis models confirm that the combination of high levels of cognitive dimension of attitudes, perspective-taking and emotional clarity explained high levels of the behavioural dimension of attitude.

Conclusions: Empathy and emotional intelligence are predictors of nurses' attitudes towards communication, and the cognitive dimension of attitude is a good predictor of the behavioural dimension of attitudes towards communication of nurses in both regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. In general, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis models appear to be better predictors than the regression models are.

Relevance to clinical practice: To evaluate current practices, establish intervention strategies and evaluate their effectiveness. The evaluation of these variables and their relationships are important in creating a satisfied and sustainable workforce and improving quality of care and patient health.

In domain questions,What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterized by?,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts, and are associated with restricted patterns of behavior. The developmental quotient (DQ) is based on the developmental age and chronological age of children.","Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts, and are associated with restricted patterns of behavior. The developmental quotient (DQ) is based on the developmental age and chronological age of children. This study investigated the utility of the DQ to estimate cognitive ability in young children with ASD.

Methods: The DQ and intelligence quotient (IQ) were assessed using the Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development 2001 (KSPD) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC-III), respectively. The correlation between the DQ and IQ was then analyzed among children with ASD.

Results: We enrolled 18 children with ASD (16 boys, two girls; age, 63.6 ± 9.4 months; age range, 45-83 months). Overall, Cognitive-Adaptive and Language-Social DQ scores were significantly correlated with IQ score in the full scale, verbal, and performance domains. Full-scale IQ and overall DQ had a linear correlation (y = -22.747 + 1.177x, R2 = 0.677, R = 0.823).

Conclusions: The DQ scores obtained using the KSPD were a reasonable estimate of cognitive ability in children with ASD. The KSPD may be a useful alternative to the WISC-III for young children with ASD and could facilitate earlier assessment.

Query contains named entities that should be treated in a special way,What is the TT100K dataset?,"The Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) traffic sign dataset. (It is a dataset for traffic sign detection, which contains 100,000 images with 224,024 annotated traffic signs.)","Traffic sign detection is an essential component of an intelligent transportation system, since it provides critical road traffic data for vehicle decision-making and control. To solve the challenges of small traffic signs, inconspicuous characteristics, and low detection accuracy, a traffic sign recognition method based on improved (You Only Look Once v3) YOLOv3 is proposed. The spatial pyramid pooling structure is fused into the YOLOv3 network structure to achieve the fusion of local features and global features, and the fourth feature prediction scale of 152 × 152 size is introduced to make full use of the shallow features in the network to predict small targets. Furthermore, the bounding box regression is more stable when the distance-IoU (DIoU) loss is used, which takes into account the distance between the target and anchor, the overlap rate, and the scale. The Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) traffic sign dataset's 12 anchors are recalculated using the K-means clustering algorithm, while the dataset is balanced and expanded to address the problem of an uneven number of target classes in the TT100K dataset. The algorithm is compared to YOLOv3 and other commonly used target detection algorithms, and the results show that the improved YOLOv3 algorithm achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 77.3%, which is 8.4% higher than YOLOv3, especially in small target detection, where the mAP is improved by 10.5%, greatly improving the accuracy of the detection network while keeping the real-time performance as high as possible. The detection network's accuracy is substantially enhanced while keeping the network's real-time performance as high as possible.

Handle fully specified questions that might contain stop words etc.,The best fit between brain traits and degrees of intelligence among mammals is reached by?,"The best fit between brain traits and degrees of intelligence among mammals is reached by a combination of the number of cortical neurons, neuron packing density, interneuronal distance and axonal conduction velocity--factors that determine general information processing capacity (IPC), as reflected by general intelligence. The highest IPC is found in humans, followed by the great apes, Old World and New World monkeys.","Many attempts have been made to correlate degrees of both animal and human intelligence with brain properties. With respect to mammals, a much-discussed trait concerns absolute and relative brain size, either uncorrected or corrected for body size. However, the correlation of both with degrees of intelligence yields large inconsistencies, because although they are regarded as the most intelligent mammals, monkeys and apes, including humans, have neither the absolutely nor the relatively largest brains. The best fit between brain traits and degrees of intelligence among mammals is reached by a combination of the number of cortical neurons, neuron packing density, interneuronal distance and axonal conduction velocity--factors that determine general information processing capacity (IPC), as reflected by general intelligence. The highest IPC is found in humans, followed by the great apes, Old World and New World monkeys. The IPC of cetaceans and elephants is much lower because of a thin cortex, low neuron packing density and low axonal conduction velocity. By contrast, corvid and psittacid birds have very small and densely packed pallial neurons and relatively many neurons, which, despite very small brain volumes, might explain their high intelligence. The evolution of a syntactical and grammatical language in humans most probably has served as an additional intelligence amplifier, which may have happened in songbirds and psittacids in a convergent manner.

Fully support both semantic search and lexicographical search,(Semantic query) What is intelligence?,"Intelligence is the ability to learn from experience and to adapt to, shape, and select environments. Intelligence as measured by (raw scores on) conventional standardized tests varies across the lifespan, and also across generations.","Intelligence is the ability to learn from experience and to adapt to, shape, and select environments. Intelligence as measured by (raw scores on) conventional standardized tests varies across the lifespan, and also across generations. Intelligence can be understood in part in terms of the biology of the brain-especially with regard to the functioning in the prefrontal cortex-and also correlates with brain size, at least within humans. Studies of the effects of genes and environment suggest that the heritability coefficient (ratio of genetic to phenotypic variation) is between .4 and .8, although heritability varies as a function of socioeconomic status and other factors. Racial differences in measured intelligence have been observed, but race is a socially constructed rather than biological variable, so such differences are difficult to interpret.

Fully support both semantic search and lexicographical search,"Lexicographical query) Which paper was published first? Title ""Fluid intelligence is related to capacity in memory as well as attention: Evidence from middle childhood and adulthood"" or ""What is theory of mind? A psychometric study of theory of mind and intelligence""?",Fluid intelligence is related to capacity in memory as well as attention: Evidence from middle childhood and adulthood which was published on 22 August 2019 as compared to the other paper which was published in August 2022,"Theory of mind (ToM) is an essential ability for social competence and communication, and it is necessary for understanding behaviors that differ from our own (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). Recent research suggests that tasks designed to measure ToM do not adequately capture a single ToM ability (Warnell & Redcay, 2019; Quesque & Rossetti, 2020) and, instead, might be related to tasks of general cognitive ability (Coyle, Elpers, Gonzalez, Freeman, & Baggio, 2018). This hinders the interpretation of experimental findings and puts into question the validity of the ToM construct. The current study is the first psychometric assessment of the structure of ToM to date. Comparing ToM to crystallized intelligence (Gc) and fluid intelligence (Gf), the study aims to (a) understand whether ToM should be considered a monolithic ability and (b) explore whether tasks of ToM adequately assess ToM, above and beyond general cognitive ability. For this, confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and exploratory network analysis (NMA) were conducted. The results of the models largely point to the same conclusion: while ToM tasks are not merely assessing cognitive ability, they are not purely assessing a single ToM construct either. Importantly, these findings align with recent theoretical accounts proposing that ToM should not be considered a monolithic construct (Quesque & Rossetti, 2020; Schaafsma, Pfaff, Spunt, & Adolphs, 2015, Devaine, Hollard, & Daunizeau, 2014), and should instead be explored and measured as multiple domains.

Confirmation Questions [yes or no],Are forms of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable) related to objective intelligence?,No (Both forms of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable) were unrelated to objective intelligence.),"Objective: The current research comprehensively examined how grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are linked to intelligence and intelligence-related beliefs and emotions.

Method: In four studies (total N = 1,141), we tested the associations between both forms of narcissism, subjectively and objectively assessed intelligence, basic personality traits, test-related stress, beliefs about intelligence, and well-being.

Results: Both forms of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable) were unrelated to objective intelligence. Grandiose narcissism was associated with high self-perceived intelligence (Studies 1-3) and explained more variance in self-perceived intelligence than objective intelligence and the Big Five personality traits. It was correlated with reduced distress in the context of IQ testing and low engagement in cognitive performance (Study 2). Individuals with high grandiose narcissism based their well-being (Study 3) partly on intelligence and considered intelligence important for success in different life domains, especially for social relations (Study 4). Vulnerable narcissism was unrelated to self-perceived intelligence (Studies 1-3) and went along with increased distress in the context of IQ testing (Study 2).

Conclusions: The results indicate that the topic of intelligence is of key importance for people with high grandiose narcissism psychological functioning and it also has some relevance for individuals with high vulnerable narcissism.

Confirmation Questions [yes or no],"For children who participated in a task-switching experiment, where the children performed a task repeatedly (single-trial blocks) or switched between two different tasks (mixed-trial blocks), did intellectually gifted children perform quicker than the average group for both mixed and single-trial blocks?",Yes (Intellectually gifted children performed quicker than the average group for both mixed and single-trial blocks.),"The study compared the performance and brain activity of children who were intellectually gifted or of average intelligence. 13 intellectually gifted (4 girls, 9 boys; M age = 12.0 yr., SD = 0.2) and 13 average children (5 girls, 8 boys; M age = 11.9 yr., SD = 0.3) participated in a task-switching experiment. The children performed a task repeatedly (single-trial blocks) or switched between two different tasks (mixed-trial blocks). Intellectually gifted children performed quicker than the average group for both mixed and single-trial blocks. The electroencephalography P300 amplitude was larger in the mixed compared to the single-trial condition, but this effect was observed only in the gifted children. The results support the notion that gifted children are characterized by a faster maturation that leads to an 'adult-like' brain activity."
"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]","What is the Flynn Effect, and how does it change our understanding of IQ?","In 1981, psychologist James Flynn noticed that IQ scores had risen streadily over nearly a century a staggering difference of 18 points over two generations. After a careful analysis, he concluded the cause to be culture. Society had become more intelligent-come to grips with bigger, more abstract ideas over time-and had made people smarter. This observation, combined with solid evidence that IQ scores are also not fixed within an individual, neatly dispels the idea of intelligence being an innate and fixed entity. While intelligence clearly has a biological component, it is best defined, as a set of continually developed skills.","In 1981, psychologist James Flynn noticed that IQ scores had risen streadily over nearly a century a staggering difference of 18 points over two generations.

"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",How is emotional exhaustion related to burnout?,"The data indicates that a worker's age influences his/her capacity to work with method and order, and that workers with emotional exhaustion (a basic feature of burnout) have lower scores in method and order. Greater emotional exhaustion and greater depersonalization were related to lower personal accomplishment and greater burnout.","Background: This research focuses on problems relating to creativity and problem-solving capacity faced by a specific group of professionals, as they relate to worker burnout, which is prevalent in a large number of work environments.

Objectives: Our hypothesis was that creative people who follow method and order are less likely to suffer from burnout. Our objective was to demonstrate that health professionals working in surgery who are creative, methodical, and orderly have lower levels of burnout compared to others.

Design: A correlational, analytical, and cross-sectional study with 70 health professionals working in surgery.

Methods: A random sample of health professionals who worked in surgery at the Hospital Universitario de La Princesa in Madrid, Spain from 2011 to 2014 were studied. The variables considered in the study were: gender, age, profession, creativity score, method and order score, and burnout score. Measurement tools were CREA: creative intelligence (Corbalán & Martinez, 2003), MO2: method and order (Seisdedos, 1994), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a test of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment (Maslach, 1981), all of which were validated for the Spanish population.

Results: Our data indicate that a worker's age influences his/her capacity to work with method and order, and that workers with emotional exhaustion (a basic feature of burnout) have lower scores in method and order. Greater emotional exhaustion and greater depersonalization were related to lower personal accomplishment and greater burnout.

Conclusion: people who work with method and order are less likely to suffer from burnout. We did not find a direct relationship between creativity and method and order or between creativity and burnout.

Causal Questions [why or how],Why Did Cephalopods Evolve Intelligence?,"Here, we suggest that the loss of the external shell in cephalopods (i) caused a dramatic increase in predatory pressure, which in turn prevented the emergence of slow life histories, and (ii) allowed the exploitation of novel challenging niches, thus favouring the emergence of intelligence.","Intelligence in large-brained vertebrates might have evolved through independent, yet similar processes based on comparable socioecological pressures and slow life histories. This convergent evolutionary route, however, cannot explain why cephalopods developed large brains and flexible behavioural repertoires: cephalopods have fast life histories and live in simple social environments. Here, we suggest that the loss of the external shell in cephalopods (i) caused a dramatic increase in predatory pressure, which in turn prevented the emergence of slow life histories, and (ii) allowed the exploitation of novel challenging niches, thus favouring the emergence of intelligence. By highlighting convergent and divergent aspects between cephalopods and large-brained vertebrates we illustrate how the evolution of intelligence might not be constrained to a single evolutionary route."
Causal Questions [why or how],Why is intelligence associated with stability of happiness?,"In the National Child Development Study, life-course variability in happiness over 18 years was significantly negatively associated with its mean level (happier individuals were more stable in their happiness, and it was not due to the ceiling effect), as well as childhood general intelligence and all Big Five personality factors (except for Agreeableness). In a multiple regression analysis, childhood general intelligence was the strongest predictor of life-course variability in life satisfaction, stronger than all Big Five personality factors, including Emotional stability. More intelligent individuals were significantly more stable in their happiness, and it was not entirely because: (1) they were more educated and wealthier (even though they were); (2) they were healthier (even though they were); (3) they were more stable in their marital status (even though they were); (4) they were happier (even though they were); (5) they were better able to assess their own happiness accurately (even though they were); or (6) they were better able to recall their previous responses more accurately or they were more honest in their survey responses (even though they were both). While I could exclude all of these alternative explanations, it ultimately remained unclear why more intelligent individuals were more stable in their happiness.","In the National Child Development Study, life-course variability in happiness over 18 years was significantly negatively associated with its mean level (happier individuals were more stable in their happiness, and it was not due to the ceiling effect), as well as childhood general intelligence and all Big Five personality factors (except for Agreeableness).

Hypothetical Questions,What would happen if there was a direct link between diet and cognitive performance in old age?,Our models show no direct link between diet and cognitive performance in old age; instead they are related via the lifelong-stable trait of intelligence. (No correct answer here),"Background: Evidence from observational studies to date suggests that healthy dietary patterns are associated with better cognitive performance in later life. We examined the extent to which childhood intelligence quotient (IQ) and socioeconomic status account for this association.

Methods: Analyses were carried out on 882 participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study. Four dietary patterns were extracted using principal components analysis of a food frequency questionnaire, namely ""Mediterranean-style,"" ""health aware,"" ""traditional,"" and ""sweet foods."" Cognitive function was assessed at the age of 70 years, including general (g) cognitive ability, processing speed, memory, and verbal ability.

Results: Before adjustment for childhood IQ and socioeconomic status, the ""Mediterranean-style"" dietary pattern was associated with significantly better cognitive performance (effect size as partial eta-square (ηp(2)) range = 0.005 to 0.055), and the ""traditional"" dietary pattern was associated with poorer performance on all cognitive domains measured in old age (ηp(2) = 0.009 to 0.103). After adjustment for childhood IQ (measured at the age of 11 years) and socioeconomic status, statistical significance was lost for most associations, with the exception of verbal ability and the ""Mediterranean-style"" pattern (National Adult Reading Test (NART) ηp(2) = 0.006 and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) ηp(2) = 0.013), and the ""traditional"" pattern (NART ηp(2) = 0.035 and WTAR ηp(2) = 0.027).

Conclusions: Our results suggest a pattern of reverse causation or confounding; a higher childhood cognitive ability (and adult socioeconomic status) predicts adherence to a ""healthy"" diet and better cognitive performance in old age. Our models show no direct link between diet and cognitive performance in old age; instead they are related via the lifelong-stable trait of intelligence.

Complex Questions,What themes emerged in the study of the use of emotional intelligence capabilities in clinical reasoning and decision-making?,"Three themes emerged: the sensibility to engage EI capabilities in clinical contexts, motivation to actively engage with emotions in clinical decision-making and incorporating emotional and technical perspectives in decision-making.","Aims and objectives: To explore clinical nurses' experiences of using emotional intelligence capabilities during clinical reasoning and decision-making.

Background: There has been little research exploring whether, or how, nurses employ emotional intelligence (EI) in clinical reasoning and decision-making.

Design: Qualitative phase of a larger mixed-methods study.

Methods: Semistructured qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of registered nurses (n = 12) following EI training and coaching. Constructivist thematic analysis was employed to analyse the narrative transcripts.

Results: Three themes emerged: the sensibility to engage EI capabilities in clinical contexts, motivation to actively engage with emotions in clinical decision-making and incorporating emotional and technical perspectives in decision-making.

Conclusion: Continuing to separate cognition and emotion in research, theorising and scholarship on clinical reasoning is counterproductive.

Relevance to clinical practice: Understanding more about nurses' use of EI has the potential to improve the calibre of decisions, and the safety and quality of care delivered.

Time based questions,"When was the paper ""On the visual analytic intelligence of neural networks"" published?",25 September 2023,"Visual oddity task was conceived to study universal ethnic-independent analytic intelligence of humans from a perspective of comprehension of spatial concepts. Advancements in artificial intelligence led to important breakthroughs, yet excelling at such abstract tasks remains challenging. Current approaches typically resort to non-biologically-plausible architectures with ever-growing models consuming substantially more energy than the brain. Motivated by the brain's efficiency and reasoning capabilities, we present a biologically inspired system that receives inputs from synthetic eye movements - reminiscent of saccades, and processes them with neuronal units incorporating dynamics of neocortical neurons. We introduce a procedurally generated visual oddity dataset to train an architecture extending conventional relational networks and our proposed system. We demonstrate that both approaches are capable of abstract problem-solving at high accuracy, and we uncover that both share the same essential underlying mechanism of reasoning in seemingly unrelated aspects of their architectures. Finally, we show that the biologically inspired network achieves superior accuracy, learns faster and requires fewer parameters than the conventional network."
Time based questions,"When was the paper ""The neuroscience of empathy and compassion in pro-social behavior"" published?",20 August 2021,"Research in the scientific literature increasingly demonstrates that empathy consists of multiple dimensions, and that defining empathy as a single encompassing term may be imprecise. Recent calls have been made for increasing empathy as means to increase pro-social behavior. However, contradictory evidence exists that empathy may reduce pro-social behavior. This debate has sparked confusion around what is empathy, along with the value of empathy in promoting pro-social behavior. This paper will examine recent advances in affective neuroscience to better understand the construct of empathy and its relationship to pro-social behavior. Individuals' responses to affective empathy, seeing the suffering of others can result in personal distress or empathic concern, which may then subsequently affect motivation for pro-social behavior. Current research in affective neuroscience suggests that combining compassion interventions in conjunction with both affective and cognitive empathy offers the most optimal likelihood that individuals will engage in pro-social behavior."

Moreover, due to several factors, including high-profile court cases, intelligence tests are legally used in an inconsistent manner in special education decision-making throughout the U.S. These cases illustrate the complex issues surrounding the psychometric properties of intelligence tests, historical conflicts surrounding racial equity, differences in federal versus state policies, and methodological concerns surrounding special education policies are discussed."
Location based questions,Fill in the blank: Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Regional Green Development under _____'s Environmental Decentralization System-Based on Spatial Durbin Model and Threshold Effect,China,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the core technology of digital economy, which leads the transition to a sustainable economic growth approach under the Chinese-style environmentally decentralized system. In this paper, we first measured the green total factor productivity (GTFP) of 30 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2020 using the super-efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM) model, analyzed the mechanism of the effect of AI on GTFP under the environmental decentralization regime, and secondly, empirically investigated the spatial evolution characteristics and the constraining effect of the impact of AI on GTFP using the spatial Durbin model (SDM) and the threshold regression model. The findings reveal: a U shape of the correlation of AI with GTFP; environmental decentralization acts as a positive moderator linking AI and GTFP; the Moran index demonstrates the spatial correlation of GTFP; under the constraint of technological innovation and regional absorptive capacity as threshold variables, the effect of AI over GTFP is U-shaped. This paper provides a useful reference for China to accelerate the formation of a digital-driven green economy development model.

Cause and effect questions,What are the causes of international differences in student assessment and psychometric IQ test results?,"Education was rated by N = 71 experts as the most important cause of international ability differences. Genes were rated as the second most relevant factor but also had the highest variability in ratings. Culture, health, wealth, modernization, and politics were the next most important factors, whereas other factors such as geography, climate, test bias, and sampling error were less important.","Following Snyderman and Rothman (1987, 1988), we surveyed expert opinions on the current state of intelligence research. This report examines expert opinions on causes of international differences in student assessment and psychometric IQ test results. Experts were surveyed about the importance of culture, genes, education (quantity and quality), wealth, health, geography, climate, politics, modernization, sampling error, test knowledge, discrimination, test bias, and migration. The importance of these factors was evaluated for diverse countries, regions, and groups including Finland, East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Europe, the Arabian-Muslim world, Latin America, Israel, Jews in the West, Roma (gypsies), and Muslim immigrants. Education was rated by N = 71 experts as the most important cause of international ability differences. Genes were rated as the second most relevant factor but also had the highest variability in ratings. Culture, health, wealth, modernization, and politics were the next most important factors, whereas other factors such as geography, climate, test bias, and sampling error were less important. The paper concludes with a discussion of limitations of the survey (e.g., response rates and validity of expert opinions).

Cause and effect questions,What is significantly associated with higher intelligent quotient (IQ) scores?,"Happiness is significantly associated with IQ. Those in the lowest IQ range (70-99) reported the lowest levels of happiness compared with the highest IQ group (120-129). Mediation analysis using the continuous IQ variable found dependency in activities of daily living, income, health and neurotic symptoms were strong mediators of the relationship, as they reduced the association between happiness and IQ by 50%.","Background: Happiness and higher intelligent quotient (IQ) are independently related to positive health outcomes. However, there are inconsistent reports about the relationship between IQ and happiness. The aim was to examine the association between IQ and happiness and whether it is mediated by social and clinical factors. Method The authors analysed data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England. The participants were adults aged 16 years or over, living in private households in 2007. Data from 6870 participants were included in the study. Happiness was measured using a validated question on a three-point scale. Verbal IQ was estimated using the National Adult Reading Test and both categorical and continuous IQ was analysed.

Results: Happiness is significantly associated with IQ. Those in the lowest IQ range (70-99) reported the lowest levels of happiness compared with the highest IQ group (120-129). Mediation analysis using the continuous IQ variable found dependency in activities of daily living, income, health and neurotic symptoms were strong mediators of the relationship, as they reduced the association between happiness and IQ by 50%.

Conclusions: Those with lower IQ are less happy than those with higher IQ.

Scenario based questions,What are the potential applications of AI systems in different nursing care settings?,No definitive answer as scenario based questions are usually hypothetical.,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of supporting nurses' clinical decision-making in complex care situations or conducting tasks that are remote from direct patient interaction, such as documentation processes. There has been an increase in the research and development of AI applications for nursing care, but there is a persistent lack of an extensive overview covering the evidence base for promising application scenarios.

Objective: This study synthesizes literature on application scenarios for AI in nursing care settings as well as highlights adjacent aspects in the ethical, legal, and social discourse surrounding the application of AI in nursing care.

Methods: Following a rapid review design, PubMed, CINAHL, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, Digital Bibliography & Library Project, and Association for Information Systems Library, as well as the libraries of leading AI conferences, were searched in June 2020. Publications of original quantitative and qualitative research, systematic reviews, discussion papers, and essays on the ethical, legal, and social implications published in English were included. Eligible studies were analyzed on the basis of predetermined selection criteria.

Results: The titles and abstracts of 7016 publications and 704 full texts were screened, and 292 publications were included. Hospitals were the most prominent study setting, followed by independent living at home; fewer application scenarios were identified for nursing homes or home care. Most studies used machine learning algorithms, whereas expert or hybrid systems were entailed in less than every 10th publication. The application context of focusing on image and signal processing with tracking, monitoring, or the classification of activity and health followed by care coordination and communication, as well as fall detection, was the main purpose of AI applications. Few studies have reported the effects of AI applications on clinical or organizational outcomes, lacking particularly in data gathered outside laboratory conditions. In addition to technological requirements, the reporting and inclusion of certain requirements capture more overarching topics, such as data privacy, safety, and technology acceptance. Ethical, legal, and social implications reflect the discourse on technology use in health care but have mostly not been discussed in meaningful and potentially encompassing detail.

Conclusions: The results highlight the potential for the application of AI systems in different nursing care settings. Considering the lack of findings on the effectiveness and application of AI systems in real-world scenarios, future research should reflect on a more nursing care-specific perspective toward objectives, outcomes, and benefits. We identify that, crucially, an advancement in technological-societal discourse that surrounds the ethical and legal implications of AI applications in nursing care is a necessary next step. Further, we outline the need for greater participation among all of the stakeholders involved.

Fact based questions,What is the TT100K dataset?,"The Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) traffic sign dataset. (It is a dataset for traffic sign detection, which contains 100,000 images with 224,024 annotated traffic signs.)","raffic sign detection is an essential component of an intelligent transportation system, since it provides critical road traffic data for vehicle decision-making and control. To solve the challenges of small traffic signs, inconspicuous characteristics, and low detection accuracy, a traffic sign recognition method based on improved (You Only Look Once v3) YOLOv3 is proposed. The spatial pyramid pooling structure is fused into the YOLOv3 network structure to achieve the fusion of local features and global features, and the fourth feature prediction scale of 152 × 152 size is introduced to make full use of the shallow features in the network to predict small targets. Furthermore, the bounding box regression is more stable when the distance-IoU (DIoU) loss is used, which takes into account the distance between the target and anchor, the overlap rate, and the scale. The Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) traffic sign dataset's 12 anchors are recalculated using the K-means clustering algorithm, while the dataset is balanced and expanded to address the problem of an uneven number of target classes in the TT100K dataset. The algorithm is compared to YOLOv3 and other commonly used target detection algorithms, and the results show that the improved YOLOv3 algorithm achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 77.3%, which is 8.4% higher than YOLOv3, especially in small target detection, where the mAP is improved by 10.5%, greatly improving the accuracy of the detection network while keeping the real-time performance as high as possible. The detection network's accuracy is substantially enhanced while keeping the network's real-time performance as high as possible.

Fact based questions,Are forms of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable) related to objective intelligence?,No (Both forms of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable) were unrelated to objective intelligence.),"Objective: The current research comprehensively examined how grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are linked to intelligence and intelligence-related beliefs and emotions.

Method: In four studies (total N = 1,141), we tested the associations between both forms of narcissism, subjectively and objectively assessed intelligence, basic personality traits, test-related stress, beliefs about intelligence, and well-being.

Results: Both forms of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable) were unrelated to objective intelligence. Grandiose narcissism was associated with high self-perceived intelligence (Studies 1-3) and explained more variance in self-perceived intelligence than objective intelligence and the Big Five personality traits. It was correlated with reduced distress in the context of IQ testing and low engagement in cognitive performance (Study 2). Individuals with high grandiose narcissism based their well-being (Study 3) partly on intelligence and considered intelligence important for success in different life domains, especially for social relations (Study 4). Vulnerable narcissism was unrelated to self-perceived intelligence (Studies 1-3) and went along with increased distress in the context of IQ testing (Study 2).

Conclusions: The results indicate that the topic of intelligence is of key importance for people with high grandiose narcissism psychological functioning and it also has some relevance for individuals with high vulnerable narcissism.

Descriptive questions,Tell me about the practical implementation of Industrial Internet of Things over 5G,"The next generation of mobile broadband communication, 5G, is seen as a driver for the industrial Internet of things (IIoT). The expected 5G-increased performance spanning across different indicators, flexibility to tailor the network to the needs of specific use cases, and the inherent security that offers guarantees both in terms of performance and data isolation have triggered the emergence of the concept of public network integrated non-public network (PNI-NPN) 5G networks. These networks might be a flexible alternative for the well-known (albeit mostly proprietary) Ethernet wired connections and protocols commonly used in the industry setting. With that in mind, this paper presents a practical implementation of IIoT over 5G composed of different infrastructure and application components. From the infrastructure perspective, the implementation includes a 5G Internet of things (IoT) end device that collects sensing data from shop floor assets and the surrounding environment and makes these data available over an industrial 5G Network. Application-wise, the implementation includes an intelligent assistant that consumes such data to generate valuable insights that allow for the sustainable operation of assets. These components have been tested and validated in a real shop floor environment at Bosch Termotecnologia (Bosch TT).

We assess the whole ALPR pipeline, starting from vehicle detection to the LP recognition stage, including a vehicle classifier for emergency vehicles and heavy trucks. We used YOLO v2 in the initial stage of the pipeline and remaining stages are based on the state-of-the-art YOLO v4 detector with various data augmentation and generation techniques to obtain LP recognition accuracy on par with current proposed methods. To evaluate our approach, we used five public datasets from different regions, and we achieved an average recognition accuracy of 90.3% while maintaining an acceptable frames per second (FPS) on a low-end GPU.","An accurate and robust Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) method proves surprising versatility in an Intelligent Transportation and Surveillance (ITS) system.

Confirmation Questions [yes or no],Are addictions associated with Emotional Intelligence deficits?,"Yes, addictions are associated with EI deficits, compared to controls. However, aspects such as the small number of addictive disorders analyzed, methodological issues related to instruments for assessment of IE and the lack of follow-up remain significant limitations.","Introduction: Emotional intelligence (EI) has been defined as the ability to perceive, understand, use and manage emotions. Studying EI could potentially be useful in understanding addictive behaviors as well as for designing and planning interventions.
Objectives: To conduct a critical review on EI impairment in addiction disorders.
Methods: MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, LILACS, and SciELO databases were searched. Articles that used the standardized Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) instrument to assess EI in people with addictions and healthy controls were selected for the review.
Results: We selected seven articles assessing EI and its associations with addiction disorders, mainly alcohol abuse and cocaine dependence. Most studies reported that individuals with addiction disorders had worse EI scores when compared to controls.
Conclusion: Overall, the studies reviewed demonstrated that addictions are associated with EI deficits, compared to controls. However, aspects such as the small number of addictive disorders analyzed, methodological issues related to instruments for assessment of IE and the lack of follow-up remain significant limitations."
Confirmation Questions [yes or no],"Does emotional intelligence (EI) have a significant correlation with neuroticism, tension, and anxiety among flight cadets undergoing simulated flight training?","Yes, emotional intelligence (EI) was significantly correlated with neuroticism, tension and anxiety. Emotional intelligence may directly or indirectly affect simulated flight performance and tension plays an important mediating role.","BACKGROUND: Flight cadets' emotion is a factor of great importance to flight training. So it is of profound significance to address how emotional factors affect flight training performance. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and simulated flight performance (SFP), and explore the mechanism of emotional state as a mediator in the effect of EI on SFP.METHODS: Ninety undergraduates took part in the study. EI (Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale), neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised), anxiety (State Anxiety Inventory), and tension (Profile of Mood States) were collected. Conducted were 9 h of simulated flight training in a simulator of the Type 6 Primary Trainer. The Delphi Experts Grading Method was used to assess students' SFP. Mediation effect of emotional state was explored using regression analysis.RESULTS: EI was significantly correlated with neuroticism (r = -0.31), tension (r = -0.31), and anxiety (r = -0.31), respectively. Multiple mediation effects showed that emotional state mediated the association between EI and SFP. Tension especially mediated the associations between the Self Emotion Appraisals and Regulation of Emotion dimensions of EI and SFP. However, the Use of Emotion dimension of EI had a direct negative effect on SFP without the mediating role of emotional state.DISCUSSION: The findings indicated that EI was significantly correlated with emotional state (neuroticism, tension, and anxiety). EI may directly or indirectly affect SFP and tension played an important mediating role. Implications for the promotion of EI and emotional state to enhance performance in real flight training are discussed.Dai J, Wang H, Yang L, Wen Z.

Confirmation Questions [yes or no],Do individuals with higher IQ show resilience to both targeted and random attacks on the brain?,"Yes, individuals with higher IQ show resilience to both targeted and random attacks on the brain, as evidenced by the study's findings. The enhanced brain robustness to targeted attacks (TA) in individuals with higher IQ indicates increased distributed processing capacity despite the systematic loss of important nodes. Additionally, brain resilience in higher IQ individuals is supported by a set of neocortical regions mainly involved in language and memory processing networks.","Neuroimaging evidences posit human intelligence as tightly coupled with several structural and functional brain properties, also suggesting its potential protective role against aging and neurodegenerative conditions. However, whether higher order cognition might in fact lead to a more resilient brain has not been quantitatively demonstrated yet. Here we document a relationship between individual intelligence quotient (IQ) and brain resilience to targeted and random attacks, as measured through resting-state fMRI graph-theoretical analysis in 102 healthy individuals. In this modeling context, enhanced brain robustness to targeted attacks (TA) in individuals with higher IQ is supported by an increased distributed processing capacity despite the systematic loss of the most important node(s) of the system. Moreover, brain resilience in individuals with higher IQ is supported by a set of neocortical regions mainly belonging to language and memory processing network(s), whereas regions related to emotional processing are mostly responsible for lower IQ individuals. Results suggest intelligence level among the predictors of post-lesional or neurodegenerative recovery, also promoting the evolutionary role of higher order cognition, and simultaneously suggesting a new framework for brain stimulation interventions aimed at counteract brain deterioration over time.

"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",What areas of cognition does the PCTB assess in chimpanzees?,"The PCTB assesses areas of cognition including physical cognition (e.g., quantity discrimination) and social cognition (e.g., gaze following) in chimpanzees.","For humans, there appears to be a clear link between general intelligence and self-control behavior, such as sustained delay of gratification [1-9]. Chimpanzees also delay gratification [10-12] and can be given tests of general intelligence (g) [13-15], but these two constructs have never been compared within the same sample of nonhuman animals. We presented 40 chimpanzees with the hybrid delay task (HDT) [16, 17], which measures inter-temporal choices and the capacity for sustained delay of gratification, and the primate cognitive test battery (PCTB), which measures g in chimpanzees [13-15]. Importantly, none of the sub-tasks in the PCTB directly assesses self-control or other forms of behavioral inhibition. Rather, they assess areas of physical cognition (e.g., quantity discrimination) or social cognition (e.g., gaze following). In three phases of testing, we consistently found that the strongest relation was between chimpanzee g scores and efficiency in the HDT. Chimpanzee g was not most closely related to the proportion of trials the chimpanzees chose to try to wait for delayed rewards, but rather most closely related to how good they were at waiting for those rewards when they chose to do so. We also found the same strong relation between HDT efficiency and those factors in the PCTB that loaded most strongly on chimpanzee g. These results highlight that, as with humans, there is a strong relation between chimpanzees' self-control and overall intelligence-a relation that likely reflects the role of successful inhibitory control during cognitive processing of information and intelligent decision-making.

Causal Questions [why or how],How might exposure to lead-based industries specifically impact the intelligence of school-aged children?,"Exposure to lead-based industries can negatively impact the intelligence of school-aged children by interfering with brain development and function, leading to cognitive impairments, as evidenced by a negative correlation between blood lead levels and intelligence scores.","Blood lead level and its impact on haemoglobin and intelligence among school children near lead based industries, and to supplement them with a nutritious food for its effect, were studied. Blood was withdrawn from 120 children (9-12 years) and lead was estimated by Lead Care Analyzer Kit and haemoglobin by auto analyser. Culture Fair Non-verbal Test was used to assess the Intelligence Quotient. After pre-test, the experimental group (n = 60) were given nutritional supplementation for 3 months and education on hygiene measures, while the control group (n = 60) did not receive them. Food supplementation and education significantly decreased the lead level in the experimental group (8.8±0.5 to 6.9±0.4, μg/dL, mean ± SE) but not in the control group. The intelligence score improved in the experimental group but not in the control group. A negative correlation was observed between the lead level and intelligence. No improvement was observed in the haemoglobin. This study shows that the blood lead level in children near lead based industries is high and is negatively correlated with intelligence. Supplementation of nutritious food and education on hygiene measures have decreased the lead level and increased the intelligence score."
"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",How do researchers use population decoding to characterize the neural activity within face patches?,"Researchers use population decoding to characterize the neural activity within face patches by analyzing patterns of activity across neurons to decode information related to discriminating between face and nonface objects, individual faces, and nonface stimuli.","Faces are a behaviorally important class of visual stimuli for primates. Recent work in macaque monkeys has identified six discrete face areas where most neurons have higher firing rates to images of faces compared with other objects (Tsao et al., 2006). While neurons in these areas appear to have different tuning (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010; Issa and DiCarlo, 2012), exactly what types of information and, consequently, which visual behaviors neural populations within each face area can support, is unknown. Here we use population decoding to better characterize three of these face patches (ML/MF, AL, and AM). We show that neural activity in all patches contains information that discriminates between the broad categories of face and nonface objects, individual faces, and nonface stimuli. Information is present in both high and lower firing rate regimes. However, there were significant differences between the patches, with the most anterior patch showing relatively weaker representation of nonface stimuli. Additionally, we find that pose-invariant face identity information increases as one moves to more anterior patches, while information about the orientation of the head decreases. Finally, we show that all the information we can extract from the population is present in patterns of activity across neurons, and there is relatively little information in the total activity of the population. These findings give new insight into the representations constructed by the face patch system and how they are successively transformed."

The second solution is the design of the web server intelligent management system, for relevant information. It is collected into the database of the server, allows remote access to the node and subscriber information related to storage in the database through the Internet, and searches the information to control the home lighting and temperature. This system is designed to imitate the modular scheme, which includes the central control module, sensor data acquisition module, and software module. Finally, on the browser side and the electronic devices of Android operating system, it realizes the wireless control of lighting, air conditioning, washing machine, and other devices, as well as the detection of the home environment."
"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",What were the primary goals of the Hungarian Primary Care Model Programme?,The primary goals of the Hungarian Primary Care Model Programme were to increase access to primary care for disadvantaged population groups and to offer new preventive services for all clients.,"Background: A Primary Care Model Programme was implemented in Hungary between 2013 and 2017 in order to increase access of disadvantaged population groups to primary care and to offer new preventive services for all clients. In a country with single-handed practices, four group practices or GP clusters were created in the Programme. Six GPs comprised one cluster who together employed nonmedical health professionals and nonprofessional health mediators, the latter recruited from the serviced communities, many of them of Roma ethnicity. Health mediators were tasked by improving access of the local communities - including its vulnerable Roma members - to existing and new services. Health mediators were interviewed about their work experiences, motivation, and overall opinion as members of the clusters as part of the Programme evaluation.

Methods: As part of the Programme evaluation, structured interviews were conducted with all 40 health mediators employed at the time in the Programme. Interviews were transcribed and content analysis was carried out.

Results: Three themes emerged from the transcripts. The first focused on the health mediators' personal characteristics such as motivation to join the Programme, the way their job increased their self-esteem, social status and health consciousness. Domains of the second theme of their work included importance of on-the-job training and of their insider knowledge of local communities, as well as their pride to have become members of the primary care team. The third theme covered overall functioning of the Programme of which they had mostly positive opinions, notwithstanding some criticism regarding procurement.

Conclusions: Health mediators had earlier worked in various European countries specifically to improve access of Roma ethnic groups to health services but the Hungarian Model Programme was globally the first in which health mediators as non-professional workers became equal members of the primary care team as employees. Their contribution and overwhelmingly positive experiences, along with their useful insights for improvement call for the establishment and funding of health mediator positions in primary care especially in areas with large numbers of disadvantaged Roma populations."
Causal Questions [why or how],How can clinicians improve their communication with patients to cultivate stronger relationships and promote better adherence to dietary recommendations? ,"Clinicians can improve their communication by understanding patients' values, treating them with respect, acknowledging emotional and social realities, recognizing implicit biases, being mindful of language around topics like weight and food, and using verbal and nonverbal approaches to convey empathic concern.","For clinicians, effective communication goes beyond the delivery of scientific information to include an understanding of who the patient is and what they value; treating them with respect; and acknowledging their emotional and social realities. Recognizing our own implicit biases and cultivating a more mindful approach to the impact of language, especially around weight and food, and using verbal and nonverbal approaches to convey empathic concern can improve our relationships with our patients. Patients who feel seen and respected are more likely to follow through with recommendations including dietary change, leading to improved health and quality of life."
Causal Questions [why or how],"How can emotionally intelligent leaders use their emotional intelligence to specifically address the challenges of stress, exhaustion, and the risk of moral injury brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic?","Emotionally intelligent leaders can use emotional intelligence to specifically address the challenges of stress, exhaustion, and the risk of moral injury brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting their teams, fostering effective personal relationships, and directing them towards common goals while demonstrating sensitivity to their psychological health and well-being.","Emotionally intelligent leaders demonstrate a sensitivity to their own and other people's psychological health and well-being, directing others towards common goals while developing effective personal relationships with their colleagues and team members. Emotional intelligence is particularly relevant in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, where nurse leaders need to demonstrate this skill when supporting their teams to manage high levels of stress, exhaustion and the risk of moral injury. This article explores emotional intelligence, discusses its importance as a characteristic of effective nurse leaders and managers, and suggests practical activities that leaders can undertake to develop their emotional intelligence skills."
"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",What does the concept of space topological cognition add to a target driven visual navigation model?,"Space topological cognition adds the following to the navigation model:

Understanding of spatial relationships: This helps the model grasp how places relate to each other.
Flexible path planning and detour behavior: Enables the model to find alternative routes or create detours when the original path is blocked.
Adaptability: Allows the model to generalize its navigation skills to new or slightly changed environments.","Target-driven visual navigation is essential for many applications in robotics, and it has gained increasing interest in recent years. In this work, inspired by animal cognitive mechanisms, we propose a novel navigation architecture that simultaneously learns exploration policy and encodes environmental structure. First, to learn exploration policy directly from raw visual input, we use deep reinforcement learning as the basic framework and allow agents to create rewards for themselves as learning signals. In our approach, the reward for the current observation is driven by curiosity and calculated by a count-based approach and temporal distance. While agents learn exploration policy, we use temporal distance to find waypoints in observation sequences and incrementally describe the structure of the environment in a way that integrates episodic memory. Finally, space topological cognition is integrated into the model as a path planning module and combined with a locomotion network to obtain a more generalized approach to navigation. We test our approach in the DMlab, a visually rich 3D environment, and validate its exploration efficiency and navigation performance through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our approach can explore and encode the environment more efficiently and has better capability in dealing with stochastic objects. In navigation tasks, agents can use space topological cognition to effectively reach the target and guide detour behaviour when a path is unavailable, exhibiting good environmental adaptability."
"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",What is Delay Discounting (DD)? ,Delay discounting (DD) refers to how rapidly an individual devalues goods based on delays to receipt.,"Delay discounting (DD) refers to how rapidly an individual devalues goods based on delays to receipt. DD usually is considered a trait variable but can be state dependent, yet few studies have assessed commodity valuation at short, naturalistically relevant time intervals that might enable state-dependent analysis. This study aimed to determine whether drug-use impulsivity and intelligence influence heroin DD at short (ecologically relevant) delays during two pharmacological states (heroin satiation and withdrawal). Out-of-treatment, intensive heroin users (n = 170; 53.5% African American; 66.7% male) provided complete DD data during imagined heroin satiation and withdrawal. Delays were 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours; maximum delayed heroin amount was thirty $10 bags. Indifference points were used to calculate area under the curve (AUC). We also assessed drug-use impulsivity (subscales from the Impulsive Relapse Questionnaire [IRQ]) and estimated intelligence (Shipley IQ) as predictors of DD. Heroin discounting was greater (smaller AUC) during withdrawal than satiation. In regression analyses, lower intelligence and IRQ Capacity for Delay as well as higher IRQ Speed (to return to drug use) predicted greater heroin discounting in the satiation condition. Lower intelligence and higher IRQ Speed predicted greater discounting in the withdrawal condition. Sex, race, substance use variables, and other IRQ subscales were not significantly related to the withdrawal or satiation DD behavior. In summary, heroin discounting was temporally rapid, pharmacologically state dependent, and predicted by drug-use impulsivity and estimated intelligence. These findings highlight a novel and sensitive measure of acute DD that is easy to administer."
Comparative questions,Are children with less severe ASD symptoms and with higher I.Q. diagnosed at earlier or later ages?,Children with less severe ASD symptoms and with higher I.Q. are also diagnosed at later ages.,"Objective: This study sought to identify factors that may be associated with delays in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis, including birth cohort, sociodemographic characteristics, and clinical features.

Methods: Participants included 1716 children and adolescents with ASD enrolled in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (AS-ATN) between the years 2008 and 2011. Data were collected at enrollment using AS-ATN parent- and clinician-report forms and standardized measures of I.Q., ASD symptoms, adaptive function, and psychiatric symptoms.

Results: Age at first ASD diagnosis was positively correlated with current age, suggesting a birth cohort effect. Sociodemographic and clinical features were also associated with age at diagnosis, even after controlling for current age. Hierarchical linear regression results showed that older current age, lower socioeconomic status (SES), higher I.Q. score, and lower levels of autism symptoms were associated with later age at initial diagnosis. There was also a significant interaction between current age and I.Q., with higher functioning children being diagnosed at younger ages than in previous years.

Conclusions: Early diagnosis of ASD is critically important for improving access to interventions; however, many children experience diagnostic delays. In this sample, children from the most recent birth cohorts were diagnosed earlier, suggesting that early signs of ASD are being increasingly recognized. However, socioeconomic barriers to diagnosis still seem to exist. Children with less severe ASD symptoms and with higher I.Q. are also diagnosed at later ages. Efforts are still needed to reduce diagnostic disparities for families of low SES and to improve early recognition of more subtle symptoms."
"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",What emerging field of study addresses the limitations of traditional safety ergonomics in the era of big data with the aim to enhance both safety and cleaner production practices?,The emerging field of study addressing the limitations of traditional safety ergonomics in the era of big data is called Intelligent Safety Ergonomics (ISE).,"Safety ergonomics is an important branch of safety science and environmental engineering. As humans enter the era of big data, the development of information technology has brought new opportunities and challenges to the innovation, transformation, and upgrading of safety ergonomics, as the traditional safety ergonomics theory has gradually failed to adapt to the need for safe and clean production. Intelligent safety ergonomics (ISE) is regarded as a new direction for the development of safety ergonomics in the era of big data. Unfortunately, since ISE is an emerging concept, there is no research to clarify its basic problems, which leads to a lack of theoretical guidance for the research and practice of ISE. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional safety ergonomics theories and methods, first of all, this paper answers the basic questions of ISE, including the basic concepts, characteristics, attributes, contents, and research objects. Then, practical application functions of ISE are systematically clarified. Finally, following the life cycle of the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the system, it ends with a discussion of the challenges and application prospects of ISE. The conclusion shows that ISE is a cleaner research direction for ergonomics in the era of big data, that it can deepen the understanding of humans, machines, and environment systems, and it can provide a new method for further research on safety and cleaner production. Overall, this paper not only helps safety researchers and practitioners to correctly understand the concept of intelligent safety ergonomics, but it will certainly inject energy and vitality into the development of safety ergonomics and cleaner production."
Complex Questions,"Examining the relationship between cognitive intelligence (CI), emotional intelligence (EI), and religiosity, what implications could this have for understanding the complexity of belief systems and differences in religious affiliation?","The relationship between cognitive and emotional intelligence and religiosity is multifaceted. While cognitive intelligence shows a negative association with some measures of religiosity, emotional intelligence does not exhibit a direct relationship. However, when considered together, emotional intelligence becomes a significant predictor of religiosity, mediated by empathy. The presence of reciprocal suppression between cognitive and emotional intelligence highlights the intricate dynamics involved in understanding how different types of intelligence influence religious beliefs. ","The negative association between cognitive intelligence (CI) and religiosity has been widely studied and is now well documented. In contrast, the role of emotional intelligence (EI) in this context has been poorly investigated thus far. Some available data indicate that EI, unlike CI, correlates positively with religiosity. To date, however, no study has explored the relationship between religiosity and both intelligences simultaneously. In current studies (Ns = 301 and 200), we examined the interplay between all three constructs. The results showed that CI was positively correlated with ability EI and negatively with some measures of religiosity. EI, on the other hand, revealed no direct, significant relationship with religiosity. However, when combined into a single regression model with CI, EI became a significant positive predictor of religiosity. Moreover, Study 2 revealed that the link between EI and religiosity was mediated by empathy. Interestingly, we also found a reciprocal suppression between CI and EI, since both predictors increased their influence on religiosity when analyzed together. Although the suppression was present in both studies, it was observed for different religiosity measures in each case, indicating that this effect is probably dependent on various factors, such as sample structure or type of religiosity.

"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",How do individual differences in information processing speed correlate to general intelligence?,"Individual differences in information processing speed are positively correlated with general intelligence, with more intelligent individuals demonstrating faster higher-order information processing that explains about 80% of the variance in general intelligence. This relationship is mediated by the efficiency of information transmission from frontal attention and working memory processes to temporal-parietal memory storage areas.","Individual differences in the speed of information processing have been hypothesized to give rise to individual differences in general intelligence. Consistent with this hypothesis, reaction times (RTs) and latencies of event-related potential have been shown to be moderately associated with intelligence. These associations have been explained either in terms of individual differences in some brain-wide property such as myelination, the speed of neural oscillations, or white-matter tract integrity, or in terms of individual differences in specific processes such as the signal-to-noise ratio in evidence accumulation, executive control, or the cholinergic system. Here we show in a sample of 122 participants, who completed a battery of RT tasks at 2 laboratory sessions while an EEG was recorded, that more intelligent individuals have a higher speed of higher-order information processing that explains about 80% of the variance in general intelligence. Our results do not support the notion that individuals with higher levels of general intelligence show advantages in some brain-wide property. Instead, they suggest that more intelligent individuals benefit from a more efficient transmission of information from frontal attention and working memory processes to temporal-parietal processes of memory storage.

"Factoid-type Questions [what, which, when, who, how]",How is fluid reasoning (Gf) related with working memory (WM)? ,There is a strong relation between fluid reasoning (Gf) and working memory (WM). Gf depends on WM to hold necessary information in a span of awareness until the reasoning task is completed. The influence of time constraints on the Gf-WM relation indicates that the abilities to control attention and inhibit interference may be the underlying traits that account for the Gf-WM relation.,The strong relation between fluid reasoning (Gf) and working memory (WM) is well established. Gf depends on WM to hold necessary information in a span of awareness until the reasoning task is completed. The influence of time constraints on the Gf-WM relation indicates that the abilities to control attention and inhibit interference may be the underlying traits that account for the Gf-WM relation. Neuroanatomy also explains the interrelations among these cognitive processes. Neuroimaging (fMRI) studies have confirmed that the same regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are active during Gf and WM functioning. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC) is also a critical structure for attention functions and inhibition.
Descriptive questions,Tell me about the the effect of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence on decision-making,"Research indicates a significant positive relationship of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence with the quality of decision-making, and a negative relationship with deliberation time and risk-taking. Cognitive skills transfer may explain the higher decision-making scores associated with higher athletic expertise, while individuals with higher trait emotional intelligence may anticipate better the emotional consequences linked with a gambling task, which may help individuals make better decisions and take less risks.","The quality of decision and assessment of risk are key determinants of successful sport performance. Athletes differ fundamentally in their decision-making ability according to their athletic expertise level. Moreover, given the influence of emotions on decision-making, it is likely that a trait reflecting emotional functioning, trait emotional intelligence, may also influence decision-making. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the respective contribution of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence to non-athletic decision-making. In total, 269 participants aged between 18 and 26 years with a range of athletic experience i.e. none (n = 71), novice (n = 54), amateur (n = 55), elite (n = 45) and super-elite (n = 44), completed the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Regression modelling indicated a significant positive relationship of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence with the quality of decision-making, and a negative relationship with deliberation time and risk-taking. Cognitive skills transfer may explain the higher decision-making scores associated with higher athletic expertise, while individuals with higher trait emotional intelligence may anticipate better the emotional consequences linked with a gambling task, which may help individuals make better decisions and take less risks."
