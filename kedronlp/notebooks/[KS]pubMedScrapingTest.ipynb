This theorizing defines a concept as a person's unique and individual information about a category and a category as a set of things in the world. An example of a concept/category pair is 'dog', with the category being the set of all dogs and an individual's concept of dog being his or her personal knowledge of dogs. This knowledge can be used to place things in or out of the category. Different individuals may have somewhat different knowledge about the same category and a single word may label several different concept/category pairs. A concept of intelligence thus consists of information about a general category labelled by the word 'intelligence'. This study analyses three major concept/category pairs of 'intelligence': \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m1\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m Spearman's g; \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m2\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m intelligence as a property of behaviour; and \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m3\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m intelligence as a set of abilities.

Machine learning can identify patterns that predict high or increasing risk for clinical deterioration from a sepsis-like illness. In developing this potential addition to NICU care, careful consideration should be given to the data and methods used to develop, validate, and evaluate prediction models. When an AI system alerts clinicians to a change in a patient's condition that warrants a bedside evaluation, human intelligence and experience come into play to determine an appropriate course of action: evaluate and treat or wait and watch closely. With intelligently developed, validated, and implemented AI sepsis systems, both clinicians and patients stand to benefit. IMPACT: This narrative review highlights the application of AI in neonatal sepsis prediction. It describes issues in clinical prediction model development specific to this population.

It predicts more and is implicated in a wider range of behaviour than any other psychological construct. The empirical support for g is extensive and overwhelming. It would seem that g is the perfect phenotypic definition of intelligence. I argue that it is not the perfect phenotype.

Current formulations of g are largely silent about the composition of g. I argue that g is actually made of further separable basic cognitive processes and does not represent a single underlying entity.

Thus, intelligent species will generally be cultural species. Direct tests of the cultural intelligence hypothesis require good estimates of the amount and kind of social learning taking place in nature in a broad variety of species. These estimates are lacking so far.

The biological neural network has led to the realization of complex deep neural network architectures that are used to develop versatile applications, such as text processing, speech recognition, object detection, etc. Additionally, neuroscience helps to validate the existing AI-based models. Reinforcement learning in humans and animals has inspired computer scientists to develop algorithms for reinforcement learning in artificial systems, which enables those systems to learn complex strategies without explicit instruction. Such learning helps in building complex applications, like robot-based surgery, autonomous vehicles, gaming applications, etc. In turn, with its ability to intelligently analyze complex data and extract hidden patterns, AI fits as a perfect choice for analyzing neuroscience data that are very complex. Large-scale AI-based simulations help neuroscientists test their hypotheses. Through an interface with the brain, an AI-based system can extract the brain signals and commands that are generated according to the signals. These commands are fed into devices, such as a robotic arm, which helps in the movement of paralyzed muscles or other human parts.

We examine human attributions of intelligence in three experiments that use MST and find that participants used both outcome and planning as indicators of intelligence.

Animals with opportunities for social learning indeed do so. Moreover, more frequent opportunities for social learning should boost an individual's repertoire of learned skills. This prediction is confirmed by comparisons among wild great ape populations and by social deprivation and enculturation experiments. These findings shaped the cultural intelligence hypothesis, which complements the traditional benefit hypotheses for the evolution of intelligence by specifying the conditions in which these benefits can be reaped. The evolutionary version of the hypothesis argues that species with frequent opportunities for social learning should more readily respond to selection for a greater number of learned skills. Because improved social learning also improves asocial learning, the hypothesis predicts a positive interspecific correlation between social-learning performance and individual learning ability. Variation among primates supports this prediction. The hypothesis also predicts that more heavily cultural species should be more intelligent.

Evolutionary psychology, with its emphasis on domain-specific mental modules, seems to offer hope for advancing understanding of this question. We know that the mind has been shaped by natural selection to maximize reproductive success. This tells us what the mind must do--it must solve the adaptive problems that the organism confronts. However, whether this functional capacity is manifest in congruent anatomic, physiological, genetic, cognitive or psychometric structures is another matter. Examination of how natural selection shaped other mechanisms suggests that knowing functional demands provides only modest guidance as to the structure of mechanisms. None the less, it remains simultaneously clear that these mechanisms are not entirely general, but have been shaped to cope with specific challenges. Our metaphors for the mind, whether as a digital computer or a Swiss army knife, are misleading because computers and tools are products of intelligent design. In contrast, minds are products of natural selection whose intertwined components are products of incorporated genetic mutations whose effects are widespread and constrained by historical precedents. Our tendencies to describe the structure of the mind in terms of discrete components make it difficult for us to comprehend the mind as a mind.

While the current video understanding techniques rely on deep learning, the obtained results suffer from a lack of real trustful meaning. Deep learning recognizes patterns from big data, leading to deep feature abstraction, not deep understanding. Deep learning tries to understand multimedia production by analyzing its content. We cannot understand the semantics of a multimedia file by analyzing its content only. Events occurring in a scene earn their meanings from the context containing them. A screaming kid could be scared of a threat or surprised by a lovely gift or just playing in the backyard. Artificial intelligence is a heterogeneous process that goes beyond learning. In this article, we discuss the heterogeneity of AI as a process that includes innate knowledge, approximations, and context awareness. We present a context-aware video understanding technique that makes the machine intelligent enough to understand the message behind the video stream. The main purpose is to understand the video stream by extracting real meaningful concepts, emotions, temporal data, and spatial data from the video context. The diffusion of heterogeneous data patterns from the video context leads to accurate decision-making about the video message and outperforms systems that rely on deep learning. Objective and subjective comparisons prove the accuracy of the concepts extracted by the proposed context-aware technique in comparison with the current deep learning video understanding techniques. Both systems are compared in terms of retrieval time, computing time, data size consumption, and complexity analysis. Comparisons show a significant efficient resource usage of the proposed context-aware system, which makes it a suitable solution for real-time scenarios.

Moreover, Study 2 revealed that the link between EI and religiosity was mediated by empathy. Interestingly, we also found a reciprocal suppression between CI and EI, since both predictors increased their influence on religiosity when analyzed together.

Humans and technology are intertwined within multiple autopoietic loops of stress, care, and intelligence. This paper suggests that technology should not be seen as a mere tool serving humans' needs, but rather as a partner in a rich relationship with humans. Our model for understanding autopoietic systems applies equally to biological, technological, and hybrid systems. Regardless of their substrates, all intelligent agents can be understood as needing to respond to a perceived mismatch between what is and what should be. We take this observation, which is evidence of intrinsic links between ontology and ethics, as the basis for proposing a stress-care-intelligence feedback loop \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mSCI loop for short\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. We note that the SCI loop provides a perspective on agency that does not require recourse to explanatorily burdensome notions of permanent and singular essences. SCI loops can be seen as individuals only by virtue of their dynamics, and are thus intrinsically integrative and transformational. We begin by considering the transition from poiesis to autopoiesis in Heidegger and the subsequent enactivist tradition, and on this basis formulate and explain the SCI loop. In an acknowledgment of Maturana's and Varela's project, our findings are considered against the backdrop of a classic Buddhist model for the cultivation of intelligence, known as the bodhisattva. We conclude by noting that SCI loops of human and technological agency can be seen as mutually integrative by noticing the stress-transfers between them. The loop framework thus acknowledges encounters and interactions between humans and technology in a way that does not relegate one to the subservience of the other \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mneither in ontological nor in ethical terms\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, suggesting instead integration and mutual respect as the default for their engagements.

Genetic influences on EFs are very high, even in middle childhood, but the extent to which these genetic influences overlap with those on intelligence is unclear.

Residual variation in general intelligence was influenced only by shared and nonshared environmental factors, and there remained no genetic variance in general intelligence that was unique of EF.

Despite its importance in defining human behaviour, the neural networks responsible for intelligence are not well understood. The dominant view from neuroimaging work suggests that intelligent performance on a range of tasks is underpinned by segregated interactions in a fronto-parietal network of brain regions. Here we asked whether fronto-parietal interactions associated with intelligence are ubiquitous, or emerge from more widespread associations in a task-free context. First we undertook an exploratory mapping of the existing literature on functional connectivity associated with intelligence. Next, to empirically test hypotheses derived from the exploratory mapping, we performed network analyses in a cohort of 317 unrelated participants from the Human Connectome Project. Our results revealed a novel contribution of across-network interactions between default-mode and fronto-parietal networks to individual differences in intelligence at rest. Specifically, we found that greater connectivity in the resting state was associated with higher intelligence scores. Our findings highlight the need to broaden the dominant fronto-parietal conceptualisation of intelligence to encompass more complex and context-specific network dynamics.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Group intelligence has opened a new era of intelligent sports service. Group intelligence has become an important factor in the development and growth of community intelligent sports service for the elderly and has become a hot topic at present. However, intelligence has encountered difficulties on the road of development. At present, the aging of the population is getting worse and worse, and the elderly have higher and higher requirements for fitness and leisure services, which leads to the need for sports services to be continuously strengthened. The distribution of resources is uneven, the data is not clear enough, and the swarm intelligence algorithm is not perfect. With the adaptation of the elderly to intelligence, more intelligent, concise, and personalized services need to be developed. The most important method is to optimize the swarm intelligence algorithm continuously. In this paper, PSO algorithm is optimized and HCSSPSO algorithm is proposed. HCSSPSO algorithm is a combination of PSO algorithm and clonal selection strategy, and test simulation experiments, PSO algorithm, CLPSO algorithm, and HCSSPSO algorithm for comparison. From the experimental results, HCSSPSO algorithm has better convergence speed and stability, whether it is data or comparison graph.

In addition, English plays an essential role in the process of economic globalization, specifically in the majority of countries where English is not the native language. At the same time, as China's integration into the world grows, the importance of English has become more pronounced, and the demand for English language skills has increased. At present, China's ever-expanding opening to the outside world, its developing science and technology, and its rising international status have created an urgent need for English-speaking professionals.

At present, the traditional English teaching mode has been criticized due to a great number of issues. At the same time, the new English language standards and the change of evaluation methods have created new demands on English teaching methods. As a result, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education has brought new directions for the optimization of English classroom. In addition, diversified network technologies also provide new support for the realization of intelligent and collaborative English classroom teaching. To be specific, the maturity of English intelligent speech synthesis and intelligent speech evaluation technologies has enabled intelligent technologies to reach or even surpass the level of human teachers in certain areas. However, due to the limitations of the market environment and evaluation methods, the products that can focus on English classroom teaching are not highly intelligent and less collaborative. What is more, the process of English classroom intelligence has stagnated compared to other subjects. Obviously, from the perspective of integrating artificial intelligence technology with English classroom, it is quite necessary and feasible to design and develop an intelligent teaching assistant that can be applied to college English teaching. As information technology continues to evolve, both national and teacher levels are beginning to focus on how it can be better used in the teaching of subjects.

Against the backdrop of genetics' eugenic legacy, wide consensus held such research to be both ethically problematic and methodologically controversial. But today it is finding new opportunistic venues in a global, transdisciplinary, data-rich postgenomic research environment in which such a consensus is increasingly strained. The postgenomic sciences display worrisome deficits in their ability to govern and negotiate standards for making postgenomic claims in the transdisciplinary space between human population variation research, studies of intelligence, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology.

Attempts to cross this inferential gap when comparing human intelligence to that of animals or machines can generate great debate. Here, we discuss the challenges of making comparisons using 'success-testing' approaches and call attention to an alternate experimental framework, the 'signature-testing' approach. Signature testing places the search for information-processing errors, biases, and other patterns centre stage, rather than focussing predominantly on problem-solving success.

Much debate about the resulting Hybrid Minds focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence into the human brain through intelligent brain-computer interfaces as they enter clinical use. In this contribution we discuss a complementary development: the integration of a functional in vitro network of human neurons into an in silico computing environment.To do so, we draw on a recent experiment reporting the creation of silico-biological intelligence as a case study \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mKagan et al., 2022b\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. In this experiment, multielectrode arrays were plated with stem cell-derived human neurons, creating a system which the authors call DishBrain. By embedding the system into a virtual game-world, neural clusters were able to receive electrical input signals from the game-world and to respond appropriately with output signals from pre-assigned motor regions. Using this design, the authors demonstrate how the DishBrain self-organises and successfully learns to play the computer game 'Pong', exhibiting 'sentient' and intelligent behaviour in its virtual environment.The creation of such hybrid, silico-biological intelligence raises numerous ethical challenges. Following the neuroscientific framework embraced by the authors themselves, we discuss the arising ethical challenges in the context of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, focusing on the risk of creating synthetic phenomenology. Following the DishBrain's creator's neuroscientific assumptions, we highlight how DishBrain's design may risk bringing about artificial suffering and argue for a congruently cautious approach to such synthetic biological intelligence.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Most theories concerning the evolution of specifically human intelligence have focused either on economic problems or sexual selection mechanisms, both of which apply more to men than women.

However, a more female-specific selection mechanism concerns the distinctive maternal role in child care during the offspring's early years. It has been reported that increasing maternal intelligence is associated with reducing child mortality. This would lead to a greater level of reproductive success for intelligent women, and since intelligence is substantially heritable, this is a plausible mechanism by which natural selection might tend to increase female intelligence in humans. Any effect of maternal intelligence on improving child survival would likely be amplified by assortative mating for IQ by which people tend to marry others of similar intelligence - combining female maternal and male economic or sexual selection factors. Furthermore, since general intelligence seems to have the functional attribute of general purpose problem-solving and more rapid learning, the advantages of maternal IQ are likely to be greater as the environment for child-rearing is more different from the African hunter-gatherer society and savannah environment in which ancestral humans probably evolved. However, the effect of maternal IQ on child mortality would probably only be of major evolutionary significance in environments where childhood mortality rates were high. The modern situation is that population growth is determined mostly by birth rates; so in modern conditions, maternal intelligence may no longer have a significant effect on reproductive success; the effect of female IQ on reproductive success is often negative. Nonetheless, in the past it is plausible that the link between maternal IQ and child survival constituted a strong selection pressure acting specifically on women.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

       "\u001b[39m        \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Superb leaders have very different ways of directing a team, a division, or a company. Some are subdued and analytical; others are charismatic and go with their gut. And different of situations call for different types of leadership. Most mergers need a sensitive negotiator at the helm whereas many turnarounds require a more forceful kind of authority. Psychologist and noted author Daniel Goleman has found, however, that effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. In fact, Goleman's research at nearly 200 large, global companies revealed that emotional intelligence--especially at the highest levels of a company--is the sine qua non for leadership. Without it, a person can have first-class training, an incisive mind, and an endless supply of good ideas, but he still won't make a great leader. The components of emotional intelligence--self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skill--can sound unbusinesslike. But exhibiting emotional intelligence at the workplace does not mean simply controlling your anger or getting along with people. Rather it means understanding your own and other people's emotional makeup well enough to move people in the direction of accomplishing your company's goals. In this article, the author discusses each component of emotional intelligence and shows through examples how to recognize it in potential leaders, how and why it leads to measurable business results, and how it can be learned. It takes time and, most of all, commitment. But the benefits that come from having a well-developed emotional intelligence, both for the individual and the organization, make it worth the effort.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

In short, it has often been observed that high IQ types are lacking in 'common sense'--and especially when it comes to dealing with other human beings. General intelligence is not just a cognitive ability; it is also a cognitive disposition. So, the greater cognitive abilities of higher IQ tend also to be accompanied by a distinctive high IQ personality type including the trait of 'Openness to experience', 'enlightened' or progressive left-wing political values, and atheism. Drawing on the ideas of Kanazawa, my suggested explanation for this association between intelligence and personality is that an increasing relative level of IQ brings with it a tendency differentially to over-use general intelligence in problem-solving, and to over-ride those instinctive and spontaneous forms of evolved behaviour which could be termed common sense. Preferential use of abstract analysis is often useful when dealing with the many evolutionary novelties to be found in modernizing societies; but is not usually useful for dealing with social and psychological problems for which humans have evolved 'domain-specific' adaptive behaviours. And since evolved common sense usually produces the right answers in the social domain; this implies that, when it comes to solving social problems, the most intelligent people are more likely than those of average intelligence to have novel but silly ideas, and therefore to believe and behave maladaptively. I further suggest that this random silliness of the most intelligent people may be amplified to generate systematic wrongness when intellectuals are in addition 'advertising' their own high intelligence in the evolutionarily novel context of a modern IQ meritocracy. The cognitively-stratified context of communicating almost-exclusively with others of similar intelligence, generates opinions and behaviours among the highest IQ people which are not just lacking in common sense but perversely wrong.

Mutations in genes which code for the redundant systems will accumulate in the genome and impair decision-making. The number of mutant genes will depend upon a balance between the new mutation rate per generation and systems of elimination based on synergistic interaction in redundant systems. This leads to a polygenic pattern of inheritance for intelligence and the common diseases. The model also gives a simple explanation for some of the hitherto puzzling aspects of work on the genetic basis of intelligence including the recorded rise in IQ this century. There is a prediction that health, intelligence and socio-economic position will be correlated generating a health differential in the social hierarchy. Furthermore, highly competitive societies will place those least able to cope in the harshest environment and this will impair health overall.

The soft robots are constructed of twisted thermal-responsive liquid crystal elastomer ribbons with a straight centerline. They can harvest thermal energy from environments to roll on outdoor hard surfaces and challenging granular substrates without slip, including ascending loose sandy slopes, crossing sand ripples, escaping from burying sand, and crossing rocks with additional camouflaging features. The twisting body provides anchoring functionality by burrowing into loose sand. When encountering obstacles, they can either self-turn or self-snap for obstacle negotiation and avoidance. Theoretical models and finite element simulation reveal that such physical intelligence is achieved by spontaneously snapping-through its soft body upon active and adaptive soft body-obstacle interactions. Utilizing this strategy, they can intelligently escape from confined spaces and maze-like obstacle courses without any human intervention.

Our proposed scheme initially extracted the attribute information of nonlinear dynamic changes in physiological signals. The maximum discriminant feature subset was selected by employing conditional relevance mutual information feature selection. An optimal subset of features was fed into the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine classifier to perform classification.

Despite being 'artificially' induced, these novel behaviours and neural connectivity patterns reveal overlap with those of humans. Thus, they may provide us with a novel experimental platform for studying the mechanisms of human intelligence, for revealing the evolutionary path that created these mechanisms from the 'raw material' of the non-human primate brain, and for deepening our understanding of what cognitive abilities are and of those that are not uniquely human.

A long-held view suggests that whereas the left hemisphere is intelligent and analytic, the right hemisphere is the source of all creativity. Consequently, activating the right hemisphere should enhance creative thinking, prompting a plethora of popular books hawking a right hemisphere solution to topics ranging from drawing, to money management, to sex. More recently, an alternate proposal has suggested that creativity is not a lateralised function; instead, creativity is argued to stem from the interaction and integration of information across both the left and right hemispheres. According to this view, individuals with greater interhemispheric communication and/or less-lateralised brains will evidence enhanced creative ability. This paper reviews the neural basis of creativity to determine whether creativity stems from activation of the right hemisphere, or from the interaction of both hemispheres. The relationship between creativity and psychopathology is also examined, evaluating the evidence for a causal link between disorders such as schizophrenia, hemispheric activation, and enhanced creativity. Although the research reviewed indicates greater right hemisphere activity during creative tasks, the interaction between many varied, often distant, cortical regions across both the left and right hemispheres is also a crucial component of creativity. This interaction facilitates the integration of a variety of separate cognitive abilities, fostering creative thinking. As such, creativity is better conceptualised as a distributed, rather than a purely lateralised, function; more lateral thinkers have less lateralised brains.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Likewise, in football simulation league, assigning suitable roles to each robot according to the real-time characteristics of complex and changeable field conditions is the key to win the game. In order to solve the problems of low research efficiency and poor simulation effect, this paper aims to deeply explore the application of RoboCup 3D and intelligent technology in football simulation league. Firstly, the movement speed, shooting speed, and direction of the players are measured. Secondly, a highly intelligent goal keeping and defense method and triangle attack strategy are proposed. The defense strategy is mainly that when the other team is in the state of attack, we send players to intercept the other player with the ball, and the triangle attack strategy is to use the three players in the appropriate position to cooperate with each other. The triangular attack team is composed of core attacking players and two auxiliary attacking players. This method is applied to football simulation league. RoboCup 3D simulation experiments show that the proposed method has good simulation effects in terms of ball loss rate and winning streak, which shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the research efficiency and simulation effect and has certain practicability.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

In this paper, a new fault diagnosis method is proposed to solve the problems of difficulty in integrating the fault diagnosis algorithm and locating fault parts due to the complexity of modern mechanical systems. The complexity of modern industrial intelligent systems is due to the fact that the systems are composed of multiple components and there are various connections between them. Common fault diagnosis is to design specialized fault identification algorithms for the physical characteristics of each component, and the integration of different algorithms is a major challenge for system performance. Therefore, this paper investigates a general algorithm for the fault diagnosis of complex systems using the timing characteristics of sensors and transfer entropy. The fault diagnosis algorithm is based on the prediction of multi-dimensional long time series using Autoformer, and fault identification is performed based on the deviation of the predicted value from the actual value. After fault identification, a root cause analysis method of faults based on transfer entropy is proposed. The method can locate the component where the fault occurs more accurately based on the analysis of the cause-effect relationship of each component and help maintenance personnel to troubleshoot the fault.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

On Earth, the emergence of complex intelligent life required a preceding series of evolutionary transitions such as abiogenesis, eukaryogenesis, and the evolution of sexual reproduction, multicellularity, and intelligence itself. Some of these transitions could have been extraordinarily improbable, even in conducive environments. The emergence of intelligent life late in Earth's lifetime is thought to be evidence for a handful of rare evolutionary transitions, but the timing of other evolutionary transitions in the fossil record is yet to be analyzed in a similar framework. Using a simplified Bayesian model that combines uninformative priors and the timing of evolutionary transitions, we demonstrate that expected evolutionary transition times likely exceed the lifetime of Earth, perhaps by many orders of magnitude. Our results corroborate the original argument suggested by Brandon Carter that intelligent life in the Universe is exceptionally rare, assuming that intelligent life elsewhere requires analogous evolutionary transitions. Arriving at the opposite conclusion would require exceptionally conservative priors, evidence for much earlier transitions, multiple instances of transitions, or an alternative model that can explain why evolutionary transitions took hundreds of millions of years without appealing to rare chance events. Although the model is simple, it provides an initial basis for evaluating how varying biological assumptions and fossil record data impact the probability of evolving intelligent life, and also provides a number of testable predictions, such as that some biological paradoxes will remain unresolved and that planets orbiting M dwarf stars are uninhabitable.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Accurate results of monitoring can provide data support for schools, research institutions, the public, and the government. At the same time, it is also an important basis for formulating social policies. At present, the commonly used monitoring method usually adopts time series algorithm. Through literature review, it is found that the algorithm has the problem of distortion of correct data, which affects the accuracy of monitoring results. Based on the above reasons, this article combines the wavelet function with the planning algorithm and proposes a dynamic programming algorithm, which removes the redundant monitoring data in turn and clusters the distortion monitoring data with the wavelet function, which improves the accuracy and computational efficiency of the algorithm and gives full play to the monitoring of intelligence. The simulation results using MATLAB show that the planning algorithm can eliminate 90% of redundant monitoring data and improve the extraction rate of characteristic monitoring data. At the same time, the accuracy of the planning algorithm reaches 95%, and the calculation time is less than 25\\u2009s, which is better than the static planning algorithm.

In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional safety ergonomics theories and methods, first of all, this paper answers the basic questions of ISE, including the basic concepts, characteristics, attributes, contents, and research objects. Then, practical application functions of ISE are systematically clarified. Finally, following the life cycle of the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the system, it ends with a discussion of the challenges and application prospects of ISE. The conclusion shows that ISE is a cleaner research direction for ergonomics in the era of big data, that it can deepen the understanding of humans, machines, and environment systems, and it can provide a new method for further research on safety and cleaner production.

The objective functions are the maximization of covering the emergency demands and minimization of total costs. Moreover, the use of an intelligent traffic management system to speed up the ambulance is addressed. In this regard, the proposed two-objective mathematical model has been formulated, and a robust counterpart formulation under uncertainty is applied. In the proposed method, the values of the objective function increase as the problem becomes wider and, with a slight difference in large dimensions, converge in terms of the solution. The numerical results indicate that, as the problem's complexity increases, the robust optimization method is still effective because, with the increasing complexity of the problem, it can still solve large-scale problems in a reasonable time. Moreover, the difference between the value of the objective function in the proposed method and the presence of uncertainty parameters is very small and, in large dimensions, is quite logical and negligible.

The research feature involves analyzing the Hilbert spectrum through VMD whereby the vibration signal is converted into an image. Healthy and various faults show different characteristics on the image, thus there is no need to select features. Coupled with the lightweight network, DenseNet, for image classification and prediction. DenseNet is used to build a model of motor fault diagnosis; its structure is simple, and the calculation speed is fast. The method of using DenseNet for image feature learning can perform feature extraction on each image block of the image, providing full play to the advantages of deep learning to obtain accurate results. This research method is verified by the data of the time-varying bearing experimental device at the University of Ottawa. Through the four links of signal acquisition, feature extraction, fault identification, and prediction, a mechanical intelligent fault diagnosis system has established the state of bearing. The experimental results show that the method can accurately identify four common motor faults, with a VMD-DenseNet prediction accuracy rate of 92%. It provides a more effective method for bearing fault diagnosis and has a wide range of application prospects in fault diagnosis engineering. In the future, online and timely diagnosis can be achieved for intelligent fault diagnosis.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

The results demonstrate that the driving speed of the experimental vehicle is set to 50km/h, the distance between the experimental vehicle and the target vehicle is 40m, and the target vehicle in front drives at a constant speed of 50km/h.

The actual distance between the experimental vehicle and the target vehicle is very close to the expected safe space, and the experimental vehicle is in a safe state during this process. When the experimental vehicle starts to decelerate, the experimental vehicle adopts emergency deceleration to ensure a safe distance between the two vehicles.

The games included perceiving and understanding elements of social behavior that non-autistic children can recognize. We argue that the importance of elements of social interaction such as perceiving interaction behaviors and assigning metaphoric meanings has been overlooked, and that they are very important in the social training of autistic children. Two games were compared by testing them with users. The first game focused only on the interaction between the agents and the other combined interaction between the agents and metaphoric meanings that are assigned to them. The results show that most of the children recognized the patterns of interaction as well as the metaphors when they were demonstrated through embodied agents and were included within games having features that engage the interest of this user group.

Individual differences in human cognitive abilities might be therefore described by a 'cognitive manifold' of intercorrelated tests from partially independent domains of general intelligence and executive functions. However, the relationship between these individual differences and brain morphology is not yet fully understood. Here we take a multivariate approach to analyzing covariations across individuals in two feature spaces: the low-dimensional space of cognitive ability subtests and the high-dimensional space of local gray matter volume obtained from voxel-based morphometry. By exploiting a partial least squares correlation framework in a large sample of 286 healthy children and adolescents, we identify directions of maximum covariance between both spaces in terms of latent variable modeling. We obtain an orthogonal set of latent variables representing commonalities in the brain-behavior system, which emphasize specific neuronal networks involved in cognitive ability differences.

This study examined perceptions of an intelligent engineer held by undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students in Ireland and Sweden, countries selected based on their levels of female representation in engineering education. It was hypothesised that there would be a significant difference in perceptions between countries. A survey methodology was employed in which a random sample of Irish and Swedish university students completed two surveys. The first asked respondents to list characteristics of an intelligent engineer, and the second asked for ratings of importance for each unique characteristic. The results indicate that an intelligent engineer was perceived to be described by seven factors; practical problem solving, conscientiousness, drive, discipline knowledge, reasoning, negative attributes, and inquisitiveness when the data was analysed collectively, but only the five factors of practical problem solving, conscientiousness, drive, discipline knowledge and negative attributes were theoretically interpretable when the data from each country was analysed independently.

However, it is a great challenge to achieve a highly accurate rolling bearing fault diagnosis because of the severe imbalance and distribution differences in fault data due to weak early fault features and interference from environmental noise. An intelligent fault diagnosis strategy for rolling bearings based on grayscale image transformation, a generative adversative network, and a convolutional neural network was proposed to solve this problem. First, the original vibration signal is converted into a grayscale image. Then more training samples are generated using GANs to solve severe imbalance and distribution differences in fault data. Finally, the rolling bearing condition detection and fault identification are carried out by using SECNN. The availability of the method is substantiated by experiments on datasets with different data imbalance ratios. In addition, the superiority of this diagnosis strategy is verified by comparing it with other mainstream intelligent diagnosis techniques. The experimental result demonstrates that this strategy can reach more than 99.6% recognition accuracy even under substantial environmental noise interference or changing working conditions and has good stability in the presence of a severe imbalance in fault data.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

A novel inference method to use larger inference sample sizes is further proposed to improve the performance of PRT. The effectiveness of PRT is verified on two datasets, where it achieves comparable and even better accuracies than the benchmark and state-of-the-art methods.

However, myopia would constitute a definite selection disadvantage during most stages of human evolution, which is incompatible with its moderate to high prevalence in most modern populations. The rapid upsurge of myopia over just a few decades also implies that its inheritance does not follow any of the usual patterns, and environmental factors may have an important role in precipitating its occurrence in those who are genetically predisposed. Previous studies showed that myopes were, on average, more intelligent than non-myopes, and this association had been attributed to a biological link between eye growth and brain development. We propose a pleiotropic genetic model to explain the atypical epidemiologic and inheritance pattern of myopia and its relationship with neurocognitive development. This pleiotropic gene was positively selected for its facilitation of human intelligence.

An understanding of driving intention is the key to building a collaborative autonomous driving system. In this study, the proposed method incorporates the spatiotemporal features of driver behavior and forward-facing traffic scenes through a feature extraction module; the joint representation was input into an inference module for obtaining driver intentions. The feature extraction module was a two-stream structure that was designed based on a deep three-dimensional convolutional neural network. To accommodate the differences in video data inside and outside the cab, the two-stream network consists of a slow pathway that processes the driver behavior data with low frame rates, along with a fast pathway that processes traffic scene data with high frame rates. Then, a gated recurrent unit, based on a recurrent neural network, and a fully connected layer constitute an intent inference module to estimate the driver's lane-change and turning intentions. A public dataset, Brain4Cars, was used to validate the proposed method. The results showed that compared with modeling using the data related to driver behaviors, the ability of intention inference is significantly improved after integrating traffic scene information. The overall accuracy of the intention inference of five intents was 84.92% at a time of 1 s prior to the maneuver, indicating that making full use of traffic scene information was an effective way to improve inference performance.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

This methodology uses three-dimensional \"intelligent\" avatars as interactive guides, along with information-based navigation strategies. The intelligence of the avatars is represented through physical features, behaviors, and knowledge about the user and the environment. These components establish the avatar\\'s architecture. Content personalization according to the user\\'s interest, navigation assistance according to the desired content, and avatar guides that make the virtual place more realistic and pleasant are proposed in order to involve users. A three-dimensional model of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, in Spain, is presented as a prototype for the validation of this methodology.

The framework employs a multimodal interaction strategy to predict target motion more accurately and an improved joint probability data association method to match measurement data with targets. An adaptive root-mean-square cubature Kalman filter is used to estimate the statistical characteristics of noise under complex traffic scenarios with varying process and measurement noise. Experiments conducted on a real vehicle platform demonstrate that the proposed framework improves reliability and robustness in challenging environments. It overcomes the challenges of insufficient data fusion utilization, frequent leakage, and misjudgment of dangerous obstructions around vehicles, and inaccurate prediction of collision risks.

Hartmann proposed that, in psychoanalytic treatment, intelligent reflection serves one's largest purposes by taking respectful account of non-rational but adaptive ways of appraising reality, with a view toward making the best use of non-rational as well as rational propensities. He regarded it as the kind of thinking that the sociologist, Karl Mannheim, had recommended to government planners faced with immensely complicated, incompletely masterable forces.

It is often inaccurate and inefficient to judge the vibration state of the boring bar through artificial experience. To detect the change of the vibration state of the boring bar over time, guide the adjustment of the processing parameters, and avoid wastage of the workpiece and the loss of equipment, it is particularly important to intelligently monitor the vibration state of the boring bar during processing. In this paper, the boring bar is taken as the research object, and an intelligent monitoring technology of the boring bar's vibration state based on deep learning is proposed. Based on grouping convolution, channel shuffle, and BiLSTM, a shuffle-BiLSTM NET model is constructed, which is both lightweight and has a high classification accuracy. The boring experiment platform is built, and 192 groups of cutting experiments are carried out. The three-way acceleration and sound pressure signals are collected, and the signals are processed by smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution. The original signals are transformed into a 256 × 256 × 3 matrix obtained by a two-dimensional time-frequency spectrum diagram. The matrix is input into the model to recognize the boring bar's vibration state. The final classification accuracy is 91.2%. A variety of typical deep learning models are introduced for performance comparison, which proves the superiority of the models and methods used in this paper.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Learning based on neural network, human behavior recognition method combining spatiotemporal networks, a homeschooling method integrating bidirectional short- and long-term memory networks and attention mechanisms is designed. The visual attention mechanism is used to add weight information to the deep visual features extracted by the convolutional neural network, and a new feature sequence incorporating salient attention weights is output. This feature sequence is then decoded using an IndRNN independent recurrent neural network to finally classify and decide on the homeschooling category. Experiments on the UCF101 dataset demonstrate that the incorporation of the attention mechanism can improve the ability of the network to classify. The attention mechanism can help the intelligent computing IoT model discover key features, and the self-attention mechanism can effectively capture the internal features of homeschooling and optimize the feature vector. We propose the strategy of combining the self-attention mechanism with a bidirectional short- and long-term memory network to solve the family education classification problem and experimentally verify that the intelligent computing IoT model combined with the self-attention mechanism can more easily capture the interdependent features in family education, which can effectively solve the family education problem and further improve the family education classification accuracy.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses - neural plasticity and neural activity - are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory.

These three conditions are essential to a team's effectiveness because they are the foundation of true cooperation and collaboration.

However, owing to psychometric problems associated with the measurement of individual differences in cognitive control, it has been challenging to empirically test the assumption that individual differences in cognitive control underlie individual differences in cognitive abilities. In the present study, we addressed these issues by analyzing the chronometry of intelligence-related differences in midfrontal global theta connectivity, which has been shown to reflect cognitive control functions. We demonstrate in a sample of 98 adults, who completed a cognitive control task while their electroencephalogram was recorded, that individual differences in midfrontal global theta connectivity during stages of higher-order information-processing explained 65% of the variance in fluid intelligence. In comparison, task-evoked theta connectivity during earlier stages of information processing was not related to fluid intelligence. These results suggest that more intelligent individuals benefit from an adaptive modulation of theta-band synchronization during the time-course of information processing. Moreover, they emphasize the role of interregional goal-directed information-processing for cognitive control processes in human intelligence and support theoretical accounts of intelligence, which propose that individual differences in cognitive control processes give rise to individual differences in cognitive abilities. \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPsycInfo Database Record \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mc\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m 2021 APA, all rights reserved\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Moreover, signal processing techniques are utilised to uncover statistical features and realise the general fault information. To offset the negative influence of noise in signals and achieve high accuracy of fault diagnosis in noisy settings, 1d-DCNN is adopted to extract more dispersed and intrinsic fault-associated features, while also preventing the model from overfitting. In the end, fault classification based on fusion features is accomplished by the usage of fully connected layers.

This is well established in social insects, navigating flocks of birds, and in groups of prey collectively vigilant for predators. Research in social insects has convincingly shown that improved cognitive performance can arise from self-organised local interactions between individuals that integrates their contributions, often referred to as swarm intelligence. This emergent collective intelligence has gained in popularity and been directly applied to groups of other animals, including fish.

Similarly, the integration required between these techniques to establish a unified and fully interconnected environment contributes to additional threats and risks in the Factories of the Future. Accumulating and analyzing seemingly unrelated activities, occurring simultaneously in different parts of the factory, is essential to establish cyber situational awareness of the investigated environment. Our work contributes to these efforts, in essence by envisioning and implementing the SMS-DT, an integrated platform to simulate and monitor industrial conditions in a digital twin-based architecture. SMS-DT is represented in a three-tier architecture comprising the involved data and control flows: edge, platform, and enterprise tiers. The goal of our platform is to capture, analyze, and correlate a wide range of events being tracked by sensors and systems in various domains of the factory. For this aim, multiple components have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence to simulate dominant aspects in industries, including network analysis, energy optimization, and worker behavior. A data lake was also used to store collected information, and a set of intelligent services was delivered on the basis of innovative analysis and learning approaches. Finally, the platform was tested in a textile industry environment and integrated with its ERP system. Two misuse cases were simulated to track the factory machines, systems, and people and to assess the role of SMS-DT correlation mechanisms in preventing intentional and unintentional actions. The results of these misuse case simulations showed how the SMS-DT platform can intervene in two domains in the first scenario and three in the second one, resulting in correlating the alerts and reporting them to security operators in the multi-domain intelligent correlation dashboard.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

The basic idea of the recommendation algorithm is as follows: firstly, the historical behavioural information of music users is collected, and the user preference model is constructed by using the method of matrix decomposition of the hidden semantic model; then, the audio resources in the system are preprocessed and the spectrum map that can represent the music features is extracted; the similarity between the user's preferred features and the music potential features are calculated to generate recommendations for the target user.

Finally, the model is trained and tested in this paper, and the system is evaluated in terms of both prediction rating accuracy and recommendation list generation accuracy using root mean square error, accuracy, recall, and F1 value as recommendation quality evaluation metrics. The experimental results show that the recommendation algorithm in this paper has certain feasibility and effectiveness.

The building field is plagued by energy consumption anomalies caused by a number of factors, many of which are associated with one another in apparent temporal relationships. For the detection of abnormalities, most traditional detection methods rely solely on a single variable of energy consumption data and its time series changes. Therefore, they are unable to examine the correlation between the multiple characteristic factors that affect energy consumption anomalies and their relationship in time. The outcomes of anomaly detection are one-sided. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on multivariate time series. Firstly, in order to extract the correlation between different feature variables affecting energy consumption, this paper introduces a graph convolutional network to build an anomaly detection framework. Secondly, as different feature variables have different influences on each other, the framework is enhanced by a graph attention mechanism so that time series features with higher influence on energy consumption are given more attention weights, resulting in better anomaly detection of building energy consumption. Finally, the effectiveness of this paper's method and existing methods for detecting energy consumption anomalies in smart buildings are compared using standard data sets.

By utilizing the pilot temporal operational behavioral traits, the proposed identification scheme could validate pilot legal status and dynamically adapt newly registered pilots into a well-constructed identification scheme for dynamic pilot membership management. After systemic experiments, the proposed scheme was capable of achieving the best average identification accuracy with 95.71% on P450 and 94.23% on S500.

Smart retrofitting is the umbrella term for solutions to show how we can digitalize manufacturing machines. This problem is critical in the case of solutions to support human workers.

The components of the intelligent space are detailed through the layers of the IoT in the form of a case study conducted at the laboratory. The applicability of indoor positioning systems is described with the integration of machine-, operator- and environment-based sensor data to obtain real-time information from the shop floor.

We found that knowledge about others' responses reduced the wisdom of the crowd and, crucially, this effect depended on how people were rewarded. When rewarded for the accuracy of their individual responses, participants converged to the group mean, increasing social conformity, reducing diversity and thereby diminishing their group wisdom.

Although deep neural approaches have made great progress in the field of conversation generation, there is still a lot of room for research on how to guide systems in generating responses with appropriate emotions. Meanwhile, the problem of systems' tendency to generate high-frequency universal responses remains largely unsolved. To solve this problem, we propose a method to generate diverse emotional responses through selective perturbation. Our model includes a selective word perturbation module and a global emotion control module. The former is used to introduce disturbance factors into the generated responses and enhance their expression diversity. The latter maintains the coherence of the response by limiting the emotional distribution of the response and preventing excessive deviation of emotion and meaning. Experiments are designed on two datasets, and corresponding results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of emotional expression and response diversity.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

On the basis of a basic item response model we argue that heritabilities which are based on dichotomous item scores normally do not generalize from one sample to the next. If groups differ in mean ability, the functioning of items at different ability levels may result in group differences in the heritability of items, even when these items function equivalently across groups and the heritability of the underlying ability is equal across groups. We illustrate this graphically, by computer simulation, and by focusing on several problems associated with a recent study by Rushton et al. who argued that the heritability estimates of items of Raven's Progressive Matrices test in North-American twin samples generalized to other population groups, and hence that the population group differences on this test of general mental ability \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mor intelligence\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m had a substantial genetic component.

However, recent comparative research indicates that ecological variation can also shape cognitive abilities. I synthesize the emerging evidence that 'foraging cognition' - skills used to exploit food resources, including spatial memory, decision-making, and inhibitory control - varies adaptively across primates. These findings provide a new framework for the evolution of human cognition, given our species' dependence on costly, high-value food resources.

This hypothesis has advanced our understanding of the complex social lives of animals and how individuals interact with others in their groups. Machiavellian intelligence is the capacity of an individual to alter the behavior of others around it to the individual's own advantage. This capacity is typically facilitated by complex communicative systems, social systems, and cognitive abilities. Curiously, communication among group members has not traditionally been a focus of research related to the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis. Here, we show how a focus on communicative and cognitive complexity together can elucidate nuanced manipulations for selfish gains in socially complex groups, under both competitive and cooperative scenarios.

The average error of the result vector under fuzzy cognition and the operation of the actual result is 0.20, 0.15, and 0.24, respectively, and the error value is much reduced. The simulation accuracy of the GA-LR method for residential landscape design is improved from 77% to 84.7%. The \"kappa coefficient\" is also improved to 82.3%. The conclusion shows that the weight matrix is used to analyze the high-quality performance of landscape design according to the specific situation of SC. For each specific case, FCM is effective in reducing errors over multiple iterations. Under the GA-LR method, fewer geographic location types and larger accuracy deviations can improve the simulation accuracy.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

The approach was motivated by an attempt to remove one of the most fundamental limitations of artificial neural networks-their rigid behavior compared with even simplest biological systems. This approach exploits a novel paradigm in nonlinear dynamics based upon the concept of terminal attractors and repellers. It was demonstrated that non-Lipschitzian dynamics based upon the failure of Lipschitz condition exhibits a new qualitative effect--a multi-choice response to periodic external excitations. Based upon this property, a substantially new class of dynamical systems--the unpredictable systems--was introduced and analyzed. These systems are represented in the form of coupled activation and learning dynamical equations whose ability to be spontaneously activated is based upon two pathological characteristics. Firstly, such systems have zero Jacobian. As a result of that, they have an infinite number of equilibrium points which occupy curves, surfaces or hypersurfaces. Secondly, at all these equilibrium points, the Lipschitz conditions fails, so the equilibrium points become terminal attractors or repellers depending upon the sign of the periodic excitation. Both of these pathological characteristics result in multi-choice response of unpredictable dynamical systems. It has been shown that the unpredictable systems can be controlled by sign strings which uniquely define the system behaviors by specifying the direction of the motions in the critical points. By changing the combinations of signs in the code strings the system can reproduce any prescribed behavior to a prescribed accuracy.\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Security exploitations, on the other hand, rise in complexities, aiming for more powerful attacks and evasion from detections. The real-world applicability of CPS thus poses a question mark due to security infringements. Researchers have been developing new and robust techniques to enhance the security of these systems. Many techniques and security aspects are being considered to build robust security systems; these include attack prevention, attack detection, and attack mitigation as security development techniques with consideration of confidentiality, integrity, and availability as some of the important security aspects. In this paper, we have proposed machine learning-based intelligent attack detection strategies which have evolved as a result of failures in traditional signature-based techniques to detect zero-day attacks and attacks of a complex nature.

How to fuse multi-modal information has an important impact on children's emotional analysis. Most of the current research is based on transformer, in which the self-attention mechanism module is improved to achieve the fusion effect of multi-modal information. However, it is difficult for these methods to effectively capture the effective information of different modalities. Therefore, for the task of the influence of music genres on children's emotions, this paper proposes a transformer-based multi-modal convolutional neural network. The first is to use the BiLSTM sub-network model to extract the video and audio features and use the BERT sub-network to extract the text features. Secondly, this paper uses the improved transformer cross-modal fusion module to effectively fuse different types of modal information. Finally, the transformer module is used to judge the information of different modalities and analyze the emotion from the multi-modal information.

Several psychologists agree on the view that behavioral flexibility is a good measure of intelligence, resulting in the appearance of novel solutions that are not part of the animal's normal behavior. This article tries to indicate how the supposed differences in intelligence between species can be related to brain properties and suggests that the best neural indicators may be the ones that convey more information processing capacity to the brain, i.e., high conduction velocity of fibers and small distances between neurons, associated with a high number of neurons and an adequate level of connectivity. The neural bases of human intelligence have been investigated by means of anatomical, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological methods. These investigations have led to two important findings that are briefly discussed: the parietofrontal integration theory of intelligence, which assumes that a distributed network of cortical areas having its main nodes in the frontal and parietal lobes constitutes a probable substrate for smart behavior, and the neural efficiency hypothesis, according to which intelligent people process information more efficiently, showing weaker neural activations in a smaller number of areas than less intelligent people.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

We still do not have a full picture of the development of deceptive actions in human infants and toddlers or an explanation of why it emerges. This paper applies Byrne & Whiten's functional taxonomy of tactical deception to the social behaviour of human infants and toddlers using data from three previous studies. The data include a variety of acts, such as teasing, pretending, distracting and concealing, which are not typically considered in relation to human deception.

Therefore, a revolution is necessary to overcome this impasse and facilitate the emergence of flexible electronics. Specifically, there is a growing focus on health detection, necessitating advanced flexible preparation technology for biosensor-based smart wearable devices. Nowadays, numerous flexible products are available on the market, such as electronic devices with flexible connections, bendable LED light arrays, and flexible radio frequency electronic tags for storing information. The manufacturing process of these devices is relatively straightforward, and their integration is uncomplicated. However, their functionality remains limited. Further research is necessary for the development of more intricate applications, such as intelligent wearables and energy storage systems. Taking smart wear as an example, it is worth noting that the current mainstream products on the market primarily consist of bracelet-type health testing equipment. They exhibit limited flexibility and can only be worn on the wrist for measurement purposes, which greatly limits their application diversity. Flexible energy storage and flexible display also face the same problem, so there is still a lot of room for development in the field of flexible electronics manufacturing. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the developmental history of flexible devices, systematically summarizing representative preparation methods and typical applications, identifying challenges, proposing solutions, and offering prospects for future development.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Towards this end, the framework of soft control provides a powerful tool by introducing controllable agents called shills, who are allowed to follow well-designed updating rules for varying missions. Inspired by swarm intelligence emerging from flocks of birds, we explore here the dependence of the evolution of cooperation on soft control by an evolutionary iterated prisoner's dilemma \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mIPD\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m game staged on square lattices, where the shills adopt a particle swarm optimization \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPSO\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m mechanism for strategy updating. We demonstrate that not only can cooperation be promoted by shills effectively seeking for potentially better strategies and spreading them to others, but also the frequency of cooperation could be arbitrarily controlled by choosing appropriate parameter settings. Moreover, we show that adding more shills does not contribute to further cooperation promotion, while assigning higher weights to the collective knowledge for strategy updating proves a efficient way to induce cooperative behavior. Our research provides insights into cooperation evolution in the presence of PSO-inspired shills and we hope it will be inspirational for future studies focusing on swarm intelligence based soft control.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

A complex experimental validation is carried out, demonstrating the generality, diversity, and practicality of the proposed DVMM dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed framework provides 93.95% accuracy over the more diverse DVMM dataset and 95.85% accuracy over traditional VMMR datasets.

Notwithstanding, AI is finding its way into numerous aspects of humanity including the fast-growing helping profession of coaching. Coaching has been shown to be efficacious in a variety of human development facets. The application of AI in a narrow, specific area of coaching has also been shown to work. What remains uncertain, is how the two compare. In this paper we compare two equivalent longitudinal randomised control trial studies that measured the increase in clients' goal attainment as a result of having received coaching over a 10-month period. The first study involved human coaches and the replication study used an AI chatbot coach. In both studies, human coaches and the AI coach were significantly more effective in helping clients reach their goals compared to the two control groups. Surprisingly however, the AI coach was as effective as human coaches at the end of the trials. We interpret this result using AI and goal theory and present three significant implications: AI coaching could be scaled to democratize coaching; AI coaching could grow the demand for human coaching; and AI could replace human coaches who use simplistic, model-based coaching approaches. At present, AI's lack of empathy and emotional intelligence make human coaches irreplicable. However, understanding the efficacy of AI coaching relative to human coaching may promote the focused use of AI, to the significant benefit of society.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

A planet is deemed habitable if it meets a set of assumed criteria for supporting the emergence of such complex life. In this work, we extend the assessment of habitability to consider the potential for life to further evolve to the point of intelligence--termed the propensity for the emergence of intelligent life, φI. We assume φI is strongly influenced by the time durations available for evolutionary processes to proceed undisturbed by the sterilizing effects of nearby supernovae. The times between supernova events provide windows of opportunity for the evolution of intelligence. We developed a model that allows us to analyze these window times to generate a metric for φI, and we examine here the spatial and temporal variation of this metric. Even under the assumption that long time durations are required between sterilizations to allow for the emergence of intelligence, our model suggests that the inner Galaxy provides the greatest number of opportunities for intelligence to arise. This is due to the substantially higher number density of habitable planets in this region, which outweighs the effects of a higher supernova rate in the region. Our model also shows that φI is increasing with time. Intelligent life emerged at approximately the present time at Earth's galactocentric radius, but a similar level of evolutionary opportunity was available in the inner Galaxy more than 2\\u2009Gyr ago.

As particularly informative example, tool-oriented behavior has been investigated to determine to which extent nonhuman animals understand means-end relations, object affordances, and have specific motor skills. Even planning with foresight, goal-directed problem solving and immediate causal inference have been a focus of research. However, these cognitive abilities may not be restricted to tool-using animals but may be found also in animals that show high levels of curiosity, object exploration and manipulation, and extractive foraging behavior. The kea, a New Zealand parrot, is a particularly good example. We here review findings from laboratory experiments and field observations of keas revealing surprising cognitive capacities in the physical domain. In an experiment with captive keas, the success rate of individuals that were allowed to observe a trained conspecific was significantly higher than that of naive control subjects due to their acquisition of some functional understanding of the task through observation. In a further experiment using the string-pulling task, a well-probed test for means-end comprehension, we found the keas finding an immediate solution that could not be improved upon in nine further trials. We interpreted their performance as insightful in the sense of being sensitive of the relevant functional properties of the task and thereby producing a new adaptive response without trial-and-error learning. Together, these findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the distribution of higher cognitive skills in the animal kingdom by showing high levels of sensorimotor intelligence in animals that do not use tools.

Herein, we introduce the regret minimization into multiagent reinforcement learning and propose a multiagent regret minimum algorithm.

The MDS algorithm is used to project multidimensional survey objects into low-dimensional visualization space, and the actual UPI and SCL-90 questionnaire data for 278 students of a certain major at a university provided by the cooperative unit are used. The results show that the mental health problems of student A are serious, and the symptoms of depression and schizophrenia are prominent, so it is necessary to seek psychological experts for corresponding treatment in time. By contrast, student B's mental health problems are also serious, and the user judges that student B still needs further diagnosis and treatment.

The study employed a MANOVA design with two motivational conditions and three outcomes including fluency, flexibility, and originality. Results showed that youth with psychopathic features who were given a message that intelligence grows over time, were more fluent and flexible than youth who were informed that intelligence is static. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of originality.

Analyses of the FDT suggested that EI was correlated with superior face decoding in all conditions. We also confirmed the expected gender difference, the superiority of high EI individuals, and the mediation hypothesis. Also, EI was more strongly associated with facial decoding performance in women than in men, implying there may be gender differences in strategies for processing affective cues.

The results indicate that compared with only deploying AVs, increasing the availability of IRs and V2V while reducing the deployment of fully AVs can achieve larger safety benefits in China. Increasing the deployment of V2V while reducing the deployment of IRs can sometimes achieve similar safety benefits. The deployment of AVs, IRs, and V2V plays different roles in achieving safety benefits. The large-scale deployment of AVs is the foundation of reducing traffic collisions; the construction of IRs would determine the upper limit of reducing traffic collisions, and the readiness of connected vehicles would influence the pace of reducing traffic collisions, which should be designed in a coordinated manner. Only six synergetic scenarios with full equipment of V2V can meet the SDG 3.6 target for reducing casualties by 50% in 2030 compared to 2020.

We conducted multivariate behavioral genetic analyses on two waves of longitudinal data at 42 and 60 months of age from 171 and 135 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic Japanese twins. The findings suggested that a genetic factor influenced GCA at 42 months and mediated preacademic ability at 60 months. In addition, another genetic factor emerged by 60 months that genetically mediated EF and math ability, independent of GCA. Preacademic ability at 60 months was affected by shared environments that influenced EF, rather than GCA, at 42 months. Moreover, shared environments that influenced preacademic ability at 42 months affected later GCA at 60 months.

The authors framed their analysis as an examination of the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis, which holds that the heritability of intelligence varies as a function of socioeconomic status. Pesta et al. concluded that the heritability of intelligence does not differ across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. They claimed their results challenge the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and support the hereditarian position that mean differences in IQ among racial and ethnic groups are attributable to genetic differences rather than environmental disparities. In this commentary, we outline severe theoretical, methodological, and rhetorical flaws in every step of Pesta et al.\\'s meta-analysis. The most reliable finding from Pesta et al. is consistent with the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and directly contradicts a hereditarian understanding of group differences in intelligence. Finally, we suggest that Pesta et al. serves as an example of how racially motivated and poorly executed work can find its way into a mainstream scientific journal, underscoring the importance of robust peer review and rigorous editorial judgment in the open-science era.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

Research on expertise indicates that focused practice may be the sole determinant of skill, while intelligence researchers underline the relative importance of abilities at even the highest level of skill. There is indeed a large body of research that acknowledges the role of both factors in skill development and retention. It is, however, unknown how intelligence and practice come together to enable the acquisition and retention of complex skills across the life span. Instead of focusing on the 2 factors, intelligence and practice, in isolation, here we look at their interplay throughout development. In a longitudinal study that tracked chess players throughout their careers, we show that both intelligence and practice positively affect the acquisition and retention of chess skill. Importantly, the nonlinear interaction between the 2 factors revealed that more intelligent individuals benefited more from practice.

The goal is to partition nodes into dense clusters based on both their attributes and structures. Modern graph neural networks provide facilitation to jointly capture the above information in attributed graphs with a feature aggregation manner, and have achieved great success in attributed graph clustering. However, existing methods mainly focus on capturing the proximity information in graphs and often fail to learn cluster-friendly features during the training of models. Besides, similar to many deep clustering frameworks, current methods based on graph neural networks require a preassigned cluster number before estimating the clusters. To address these limitations, we propose in this paper a deep attributed clustering method based on self-separated graph neural networks and parameter-free cluster estimation. First, to learn cluster-friendly features, we jointly optimize a jumping graph convolutional auto-encoder with a self-separation regularizer, which learns clusters with changing sizes while keeping dense intra-cluster structures and sparse inter structures. Second, an additional softmax auto-encoder is trained to determine the natural cluster number from the data. The hidden units capture cluster structures and can be used to estimate the number of clusters. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed model.'\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

To address this problem, we developed and validated a novel continuous method for dynamically measuring risk and speed perceptions. To study the factors affecting risk and speed perception, we presented participants with videos captured on the same racing track from the same point of view but with different drivers who varied in their speed and risk profiles. During the experiment, participants used a joystick to continuously rate the subjectively perceived risk of driving in the first block and the perceived speed in the second block. Our analysis of these dynamic ratings indicates that risk and speed estimates were decoupled, with curves resulting in decreased speeds but increased risk ratings. However, a close distance to the car in front increased both speed and risk. Based on actual and estimated speed data, we found that overtaking cars on curves resulted in participants overestimating their own speed, whereas an increase in the distance to the car in front on a straight course led to underestimations of their own speed.

Both classes experienced the same cooperative learning intervention programme conducted in physical education, which included two consecutive learning units for a total of 16 sessions \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m2 per week/50 min each\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. The same physical education teacher, an expert in cooperative learning, conducted all sessions. Results showed that the cooperative learning framework helped increase students' self-approach goals and their emotional control and regulation, and empathy. In conclusion, the present study reinforced the use of cooperative learning in physical education, because it can guide students to more adaptive motivational patterns and to develop their emotional intelligence. Furthermore, it contributes to the students' social and emotional learning building quality relationships, learning to manage stressors, and evolve individually and in groups.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

The biological basis of intelligence is the structure and function of human brain and the key to improve the intelligence level of infants is to improve the quality of brain development, especially the early development of brain. Based on machine learning and health information statistics, this paper studies the development of infant health diagnosis and intelligence, physical and mental health. Pre-process the sample data, and use the filtering method based on machine learning and health information statistics for feature screening. Compared with traditional statistical methods, machine learning and health information statistical methods can better obtain the hidden information in the big data of children's physical and mental health development, and have better learning ability and generalization ability. The machine learning theory is used to analyze and mine the infant's health diagnosis and intelligence development, establish a health state model, and intuitively show people the health status of their infant's physical and mental health development by means of data.

It is true that 'one must be born' for a certain medical specialty, but several components of personality might be educated with proper training. Increased levels of Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness associated with lower levels of Neuroticism might represent the key combination for achieving professional satisfaction in the medical profession. Medical students should receive proper interprofessional education, since effective interprofessional relationships among healthcare providers definitely improve patients' safety. Empathy contributes to effective patient-physician communication, improving patient trust, compliance, and satisfaction, being positively correlated with Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Extraversion. Emotional intelligence-the capacity to respond to one's own and others' emotions-was proven to contribute, in a synergistic way with empathy, to increasing empathic ability. Clinical communication skills represent a key component in medical students in order to achieve the best patient care, and they are certainly related and/or influenced by empathy, interprofessional collaboration skills, emotional intelligence and, especially, personality traits. Taking into account the complex interactions mentioned above, the implementation of effective courses based on these concepts in medical students, intending to promote the development of clinical communication skills, represents a real emergency, since it might result in a reduction in medical errors and subsequent related deaths. A thorough understanding of students' personality is mandatory before designing these courses in order to provide a training tailored to their personality styles.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

This article addresses several issues with the classic divergent-thinking methodology and presents a new theoretical and methodological framework for cognitive divergent-thinking studies. A secondary analysis of a large dataset of divergent-thinking responses is presented. Latent semantic analysis was used to examine the potential changes in semantic distance between responses and the concept represented by the divergent-thinking prompt across successive response iterations. The results of linear growth modeling showed that although there is some linear increase in semantic distance across response iterations, participants high in fluid intelligence tended to give more distant initial responses than those with lower fluid intelligence. Additional analyses showed that the semantic distance of responses significantly predicted the average creativity rating given to the response, with significant variation in average levels of creativity across participants. Finally, semantic distance does not seem to be related to participants' choices of their own most creative responses. Implications for cognitive theories of creativity are discussed, along with the limitations of the methodology and directions for future research.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

These predictive tools are meant to enable a 'precision education' that will transform society. These technological developments have not changed the fundamental aims of a program with a long history. Behavioral genetics is continuous with previous attempts to match personal characteristics to heredity, such as sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, and threatens racial and other forms of bias. From these older paradigms, it inherits an understanding of intelligence as informational processing shaped by mechanistic and computational metaphors as well as a view of society and education organized around competition. Because of these influences, these models misdescribe fundamental aspects of human engagement with the world and disregard other concepts of intelligence, which creates problems for the precision education that researchers hope to construct using genetic knowledge.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

This paper presents a robust method for recognizing and classifying defects in industrial products using a deep-learning architectural ensemble approach integrated with a weighted sequence meta-learning unification framework. In the proposed method, a unique base model is constructed and fused together with other co-learning pretrained models using a sequence-driven meta-learning ensembler that aggregates the best features learned from the various contributing models for better and superior performance.

The construct of heritability is embedded in the method of structural equation modeling widely used in modern population genetics and in human behavior genetics. The application of structural equation modeling to behavioral phenotypes is shown to be a useful and informative analytic tool, as it implements the research strategy of 'strong inference'. I describe the application of 'strong inference', via the use of structural equation models in the domain of human intelligence, and demonstrate its utility as a means of refuting well formulated scientific hypotheses. The construct of Spearman's g is shown to be a strongly confirmed scientific hypothesis. Genetic and environmental influences are shown to influence g differentially over time, with shared environmental influences predominating early in life, but dissipating to near zero by adulthood.

Any and all of such cognitive abilities reduce to these 8 levels or to combinations of them. The 8 levels are hierarchical because lower levels, generally, are prerequisites for higher levels. An animal's general cognitive ability is determined by how many of the fundamental processes it can use. Although the processes are hierarchical, an animal will use all processes available to it in serial or in parallel as the situation requires. A perusal of contemporary journals' contents will show that behavioral neuroscientists, including behavioral pharmacologists, rarely study cognitive abilities that require the use of processes at the highest 4 levels. Yet, all vertebrates may be capable of using level-5 processes, and several avian and mammalian species have been shown to use level-6 processes. The use of level-7 processes has been shown in non-human primates and likely can be shown in non-primate species, too. The present article provides an overview of the basic cognitive processes as well as types of tasks that might be used to investigate the neural correlates or substrates of higher cognitive processes in animals.

In this work, inspired by animal cognitive mechanisms, we propose a novel navigation architecture that simultaneously learns exploration policy and encodes environmental structure. First, to learn exploration policy directly from raw visual input, we use deep reinforcement learning as the basic framework and allow agents to create rewards for themselves as learning signals. In our approach, the reward for the current observation is driven by curiosity and calculated by a count-based approach and temporal distance. While agents learn exploration policy, we use temporal distance to find waypoints in observation sequences and incrementally describe the structure of the environment in a way that integrates episodic memory. Finally, space topological cognition is integrated into the model as a path planning module and combined with a locomotion network to obtain a more generalized approach to navigation. We test our approach in the DMlab, a visually rich 3D environment, and validate its exploration efficiency and navigation performance through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our approach can explore and encode the environment more efficiently and has better capability in dealing with stochastic objects.

One belief held by some educators is that intelligence is fixed, that is, some students are more intelligent and have a higher ability to learn than others. Instructors with a fixed mindset may not be convinced that their investment in developing active-learning materials will be as fruitful as the education evidence suggests, because these instructors may not believe that most students can grow in their learning. Here, we explored the relationship between fixed mindsets and the adoption of active-learning strategies.

However, contrary to the hypothesis, comparative data shows that sexual ornaments have higher additive genetic variation than similar non-sexual traits.

Since most dangers to health in the contemporary society are evolutionarily novel, it follows that more intelligent individuals are better able to recognize and deal with such dangers and live longer.

This strategy would be helpful in at least two main ways. First, it would be enormously beneficial in terms of promoting emotional intelligence - a necessary requirement for providing ethical, person-centred care. Second, it would also serve as an excellent form of student support, which would likely improve student retention rates.

In view of the problem that a convolution operation is good at extracting local features but has limitations in modeling long-distance dependence relationships, a semantic segmentation network, DE-UNet, with a dual encoder is proposed in this paper. The Swin Transformer and convolutional neural network are used to design the hybrid architecture. The Swin Transformer pays attention to multi-scale global features and learns local features through the convolutional neural network. Integrated features take into account both global and local context information. In the experiment, remote sensing images from UAVs were used to test three deep learning models including DE-UNet.

One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the \"cognitive niche.\" This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people\\'s beliefs and desires.

However, rank measurement does not allow for determinations of what level of a mate characteristic is rated most desirable. Based on a more informative percentile scale measurement approach, it was reported recently that mean desirability ratings of IQ in a prospective partner peaked at the 90th percentile, with a statistically significant reduction from the 90th to the 99th percentiles. The purpose of this investigation was to replicate the recently reported non-linear desirability effect associated with IQ, in addition to the evaluation of three other valued mate characteristics: easygoing, kindness, and physical attraction. Based on a sample of 214 young adults, it was found that all four mate characteristics peaked at the 90th percentile. However, the IQ and easygoing mean desirability ratings evidenced statistically significant mean reductions across the 90th to the 99th percentiles, whereas kindness and physical attraction did not. Finally, the objectively and subjectively assessed intelligence of the participants was not found to be associated with the participants' desirability ratings of IQ. We interpreted the results to be consistent with a broadly conceptualized threshold hypothesis, which states that the perceived benefits of valued mate characteristics may not extend beyond a certain point.

We propose a plasticity rule based on predictive processing, where the neuron learns a low-rank model of the synaptic input dynamics in its membrane potential. Neurons thereby amplify those synapses that maximally predict other synaptic inputs based on their temporal relations, which provide a solution to an optimization problem that can be implemented at the single-neuron level using only local information. Consequently, neurons learn sequences over long timescales and shift their spikes towards the first inputs in a sequence. We show that this mechanism can explain the development of anticipatory signalling and recall in a recurrent network.

Using deep features from a customized ResNet18 trained with triplet loss, the proposed pipeline consists of a face detector used to locate and refine the face bounding box and a classifier to identify the facial expression class of discovered faces. RetinaFace is used to extract the identified face areas from the source image, and a ResNet18 model is trained on cropped face images with triplet loss to retrieve those features.

Research on aspects of an infant's response to novelty and the relationship between this response and later intellectual functioning was examined and interpreted as reflective not only of one element of continuity in the actual nature of intelligence throughout development but also of a stable source of individual differences in intellectual development. Other literature reviewed suggested that the interest in and ability to deal with novelty remains an integral component of individual differences in intelligence throughout the life span. A framework for conceptualizing intelligence as, in part, the response to novelty was offered to provide some synthesis to the literature we have reviewed on the relationship between one's response to novelty and intelligence across the life span. This framework comprises two major aspects: a motivational aspect, referring to interest in, curiosity about, and preference for novelty, and an information-extraction aspect, referring to component processes that are involved in the acquisition of novel information. These two aspects of dealing with novelty were evident in the literature that was reviewed above. They seem integral to intellectual development. We are not alone in positing the importance of one's response to novelty as a major element of individual differences in intelligence across the life span. Other researchers and theorists from diverse disciplines within psychology, such as artificial intelligence, Piagetian psychology, and psychometric intelligence, as well as layperson's commonsense notions about intelligence, have also indicated the importance of the ability to deal with novelty in intelligent functioning.

       "\u001b[39m        \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"The terms gifted, talented, and intelligent all have meanings that suggest an individual's highly proficient or exceptional performance in one or more specific areas of strength. Other than Spearman's g, which theorizes about a general elevated level of potential or ability, more contemporary theories of intelligence are based on theoretical models that define ability or intelligence according to a priori categories of specific performance. Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience report on the neural basis of g from various perspectives such as the neural speed theory and the efficiency of prefrontal function. Exceptional talent is the result of interactions between goal-directed behavior and nonvolitional perceptual processes in the brain that have yet to be fully characterized and understood by the fields of psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Some developmental studies report differences in region-specific neural activation, recruitment patterns, and reaction times in subjects who are identified with high IQ scores according to traditional scales of assessment such as the WISC-III or Stanford-Binet. Although as cases of savants and prodigies illustrate, talent is not synonymous with high IQ. This review synthesizes information from the fields of psychometrics and gifted education, with findings from the neurosciences on the neural basis of intelligence, creativity, profiles of expert performers, cognitive function, and plasticity to suggest a paradigm for investigating talent as the maximal and productive use of either or both of one's high level of general intelligence or domain-specific ability.
