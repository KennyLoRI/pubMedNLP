comparative,How do resting-state functional connectivity and activity flow mapping contribute to understanding episodic memory information transfer in the brain?,Resting-state FC and activity flow mapping quantify episodic memory information transfer by analyzing signal interactions between brain regions.,"Cognitive functionality emerges due to neural interactions. The interregional signal interactions underlying episodic memory are a complex process. Thus, we need to quantify this process more accurately to understand how brain regions receive information from other regions. Studies suggest that resting-state functional connectivity (FC) conveys cognitive information; additionally, activity flow estimates the contribution of the source region to the activation pattern of the target region, thus decoding the cognitive information transfer. Therefore, we performed a combined analysis of task-evoked activation and resting-state FC voxel-wise by activity flow mapping to estimate the information transfer pattern of episodic memory. We found that the cinguloopercular (CON), frontoparietal (FPN) and default mode networks (DMNs) were the most recruited structures in information transfer. The patterns and functions of information transfer differed between encoding and retrieval. Furthermore, we found that information transfer was a better predictor of memory ability than previous methods. Additional analysis indicated that structural connectivity (SC) had a transportive role in information transfer. Finally, we present the information transfer mechanism of episodic memory from multiple neural perspectives. These findings suggest that information transfer is a better biological indicator that accurately describes signal communication in the brain and strongly influences the function of episodic memory."
yes/no,Are spatial processing methods such as median filtering and the laplace operator applied to achieve de-noising and contrast enhancement on infrared images?,Yes,"This paper presents a detection method for characterizing the bonded interface of O<sub>2</sub> plasma activated silicon wafer direct bonding. The images, obtained by infrared imaging system, were analyzed by the software based on spatial domain and morphology methods. The spatial domain processing methods, including median filtering and Laplace operator, were applied to achieve de-noising and contrast enhancement. With optimized parameters of sharpening operator patterns, disk size, binarization threshold, morphological parameter A and B, the void contours were clear and convenient for segmentation, and the bonding rate was accurately calculated. Furthermore, the void characteristics with different sizes and distributions were also analyzed, and the detailed statistics of the void's number and size are given. Moreover, the orthogonal experiment was designed and analyzed, indicating that O<sub>2</sub> flow has the greatest influence on the bonding rate in comparison with activated time and power. With the optimized process parameters of activated power of 150 W, O<sub>2</sub> flow of 100 sccm and time of 120 s, the testing results show that the bonding rate can reach 94.51% and the bonding strength is 12.32 MPa."
yes/no,Did the application of neural networks receive increasing attention in the field of chemometrics?,yes,"The development of chemometrics aims to provide an effective analysis approach for data generated by advanced analytical instruments. The success of existing analytical approaches in spectral analysis still relies on preprocessing and feature selection techniques to remove signal artifacts based on prior experiences. Data-driven deep learning analysis has been developed and successfully applied in many domains in the last few years. How to integrate deep learning with spectral analysis received increased attention for chemometrics. Approximately 20 recently published studies demonstrate that deep neural networks can learn critical patterns from raw spectra, which significantly reduces the demand for feature engineering. The composition of multiple processing layers improves the fitting and feature extraction capability and makes them applicable to various analytical tasks. This advance offers a new solution for chemometrics toward resolving challenges related to spectral data with rapidly increased sample numbers from various sources. We further provide a practical guide to the development of a deep convolutional neural network-based analytical workflow. The design of the network structure, tuning the hyperparameters in the training process, and repeatability of results is mainly discussed. Future studies are needed on interpretability and repeatability of the deep learning approach in spectral analysis."
descriptive,Describe what post-perative cystography is oftentimes used for?,Predicting postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) recovery.,"Purpose: Post-operative cystography has been used to predict the recovery of postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) in patients with localized prostate cancer. This study aimed to validate the predictive value of cystography for PPI and utilize a deep learning model to identify favorable and unfavorable features. Methods: Medical records and cystography images of patients who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Specific cystography features, including anastomosis leakage, a downward bladder neck (BN), and the bladder neck angle, were analyzed for the prediction of PPI recovery. Favorable and unfavorable patterns were categorized based on the three cystography features. The deep learning model used for transfer learning was ResNet 50 and weights were trained on ImageNet. We used 5-fold cross-validation to reduce bias. After each fold, we used a test set to confirm the model’s performance. Result: A total of 170 consecutive patients were included; 31.2% experienced immediate urinary continence after surgery, while 93.5% achieved a pad-free status and 6.5% were still incontinent in the 24 weeks after surgery. We divided patients into a fast recovery group (≤4 weeks) and a slow recovery group (>4 weeks). Compared with the slow recovery group, the fast recovery group had a significantly lower anastomosis leakage rate, less of a downward bladder neck, and a larger bladder neck angle. Test data used to evaluate the model’s performance demonstrated an average 5-fold accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 93.75%, 87.5%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: Postoperative cystography features can predict PPI recovery in patients with localized prostate cancer. A deep-learning model can facilitate the identification process. Further validation and exploration are required for the future development of artificial intelligence (AI) in this field."
comparative,Are psychological changes that underly the the increasing appetite following cannabis consumption over or under researched?,Under-researched.,"Cannabis intoxication is commonly reported to increase appetite and enhance appreciation of food (the 'munchies'). These effects are attributed to activation of the endocannabinoid system. However, the psychological changes that underlie these phenomena are under-researched. We report here the results of an extensive online survey of cannabis users with an exploratory Cannabinoid Eating Experience Questionnaire (CEEQ)."
open-ended,What are possible influental factors that distinguish prognosis between non-viral HCC and HCV_HCC groups?,"Number of tumors, HCC stage, albumin, and total bilirubin.","Various factors are associated with the prognosis of patients with non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to investigate the prognosis of patients with non-viral HCC compared with that of patients with hepatitis C virus-related (HCV)-HCC and the features associated with prognosis of patients with non-viral HCC using data mining analyses. Patients with non-viral HCC (n=182, age 70.4±8.9 years) and HCV-HCC (n=612, age 70±8.4 years) were enrolled and the overall survival was compared between the non-viral HCC and HCV-HCC groups. The present study performed random forest and decision tree analyses to identify features that distinguish prognosis between the non-viral HCC and HCV-HCC groups. The median survival of the non-viral HCC group was significantly shorter than the HCV-HCC group (1,553 vs. 2,304 days, P<0.01). In the multivariate analysis, the non-viral HCC group was an independent risk factor for survival (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08-1.87, P=0.013). In the random forest analysis, the high-ranking distinguishable factors were 'number of tumors' and 'HCC stage' in the non-viral HCC group and 'albumin' and 'total bilirubin' in the HCV-HCC group. The decision tree analysis revealed that, in patients with HCC stage >I, the survival period in the non-viral HCC group was significantly shorter than the HCV-HCC group (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.07-1.81, P=0.0132). The prognosis of patients with non-viral HCC was poorer than patients with HCV-HCC. In addition, data mining analysis revealed that tumor-related variables had the highest importance for survival in patients with non-viral HCC."
factoid,What should intervention programs for aggressive individuals focus on in order to foster behavioral improvement?,Increase cognitive empathy and explore emotional self-regulation and callous-unemotional traits.,"A strong relationship between empathy and aggression has traditionally been argued, but a recent meta-analysis showed that this relationship is surprisingly weak. However, none of the studies that were analyzed in the meta-analysis used physiological measures of empathy to assess differences between aggressive and nonaggressive subjects. The present study evaluated the activity of the corrugator and zygomatic muscles, galvanic skin response, and heart rate response to pictures with different social content in 30 aggressive and 30 nonaggressive subjects. Self-report measures of emotion and empathy were also evaluated. The results did not show significant differences in any of the physiological measures of affective empathy or subjective measures of emotion. Significant differences were found only in cognitive empathy, in which nonaggressive subjects had higher scores than aggressive subjects. These results suggest that intervention programs should focus on increasing cognitive empathy and exploring other variables, such as emotional self-regulation and callous-unemotional traits. We also suggest exploring other ways of understanding affective empathy."
factoid,What components could be considered to understand the emotional management ability of teachers.,Increase cognitive empathy and explore emotional self-regulation and callous-unemotional traits.,"The construction direction of Japanese teaching evaluation system based on hybrid teaching mode is to give full feedback to teaching process, diversify evaluation subjects and evaluation methods, and obtain comprehensive and objective evaluation results. Compared with most similar studies, more EEG data of teachers' emotional stress relief and healthy people in Japanese teaching process were collected, and a large number of features were extracted. An experiment of teachers' emotional stress relief recognition in Japanese teaching process based on EEG signal was designed. The feature selection algorithm was used to screen the EEG feature combinations of teachers' emotional stress relief and healthy subjects, and the classification experiment was carried out to verify the difference. Finally, this paper uses the feature selection algorithm of tree model and the random forest model classifier to establish the recognition model of teachers' emotional stress discharge in Japanese teaching process based on EEG signals and achieves the effect of more accurate recognition of teachers' emotional stress discharge in Japanese teaching process. First, the connotation, value, and influencing factors of teachers' emotion management ability are logically integrated and systematically expounded. Second, based on emotional psychology, emotional intelligence theory, psychotherapy theory, and management theory, teachers' emotional management ability is constructed according to the three-dimensional structure theory of intelligence and information processing theory. It is constructed from three dimensions: object dimension (teachers themselves, students, and students), content dimension (positive and negative emotions), and operational dimension (emotional perception, emotional understanding, emotional expression, and emotional regulation)."
yes/no,Do young people with a tendency towards excitement-seeking behavior also show a tendency towrards problematic gambling?,yes,"Motivational characteristics such as excitement-seeking are key components of models of addiction, including problem gambling. Previous studies have established associations between excitement-seeking and problem gambling in youth. However, these studies have employed dimensional psychological assessments which are unlikely to be routinely administered. Other approaches to conceptualize excitement-seeking could be of value. In the present study, we employed a single question (What are the reasons that you gamble?) to identify adolescents who reported excitement-seeking motivation for gambling. Cross-sectional data from 2030 adolescent gamblers who participated in a Connecticut high-school survey were examined. Gambling perceptions and correlates of problem-gambling severity were examined relative to excitement-seeking and non-excitement-seeking gambling. Gambling perceptions were more permissive and at-risk/problem gambling was more frequent among adolescents with excitement-seeking gambling versus non-excitement-seeking gambling. A weaker relationship between problem-gambling severity and moderate and heavy alcohol use was observed for excitement-seeking versus non-excitement-seeking gambling. Excitement-seeking gambling is associated with more permissive gambling-related attitudes and riskier gambling behaviors and may account for some variance in adolescent risk of heavy alcohol use. A single question may provide important information for identifying adolescents who are at elevated risk of problem gambling and associated negative outcomes, although the utility of the question in specific settings warrants direct examination, especially given the observed high prevalence of excitement-seeking motivations for gambling."
how,How could electroencephalography helpful in treating individuals after a stroke?,"EEG helps classify stroke patients, aiding post-stroke treatment and recovery.","Electroencephalography (EEG) can access ischemic stroke-derived cortical impairment and is believed to be a prospective predictive method for acute stroke prognostics, neurological outcome, and post-stroke rehabilitation management. This study aims to quantify EEG features to understand task-induced neurological declines due to stroke and evaluate the biomarkers to distinguish the ischemic stroke group and the healthy adult group. We investigated forty-eight stroke patients (average age 72.2 years, 62% male) admitted to the rehabilitation center and seventy-five healthy adults (average age 77 years, 31% male) with no history of known neurological diseases. EEG was recorded through frontal, central, temporal, and occipital cortical electrodes (Fz, C1, C2, T7, T8, Oz) using wireless EEG devices and a newly developed data acquisition platform within three months after the appearance of symptoms of ischemic stroke (clinically confirmed). Continuous EEG data were recorded during the consecutive resting, motor (walking and working activities), and cognitive reading tasks. The statistical results showed that alpha, theta, and delta activities are biomarkers classifying the stroke patients and the healthy adults in the motor and cognitive states. DAR and DTR of the stroke group differed significantly from those of the healthy control group during the resting, motor, and cognitive tasks. Using the machine-learning approach, the C5.0 model showed 78% accuracy for the resting state, 89% accuracy in the functional motor walking condition, 84% accuracy in the working condition, and 85% accuracy in the cognitive reading state for classification the stroke group and the control group. This study is expected to be helpful for post-stroke treatment and post-stroke recovery."
factoid,What is a reliable measure for verbal intelligence?,The Ammons Quick Test (QT) is a reliable measure for verbal intelligence.,"After selection using a random number table, from volunteer referrals, 89 Youth (61 boys, 28 girls; 48 African Americans, 2 Asian Americans, 27 Euro-Americans, 12 Hispanic Americans), and 147 Adults (107 men, 40 women; 11 African Americans, 6 Asian Americans, 124 Euro-Americans, 6 Hispanic Americans) were administered the Ammons Quick Test (QT). Means, confidence intervals, standard deviations, and Pearson product-moment correlations among tests were computed. The Ammons QT was moderately to strongly and significantly correlated statistically with: the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-3b (PPVT-3b); the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2 Parent/Teacher Form; the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-4) or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-4); and the Wide Range Achievement Test-Fourth Edition (WRAT-4) Blue and Green Forms. After 51 years, the original norms for the Ammons QT remain valid measures of receptive vocabulary, verbal intelligence, and auditory information processing useful to clinicians."
multiple-choice,What might be a new method for identifying circRNA-disease associations? a) a neural network based methodology called HMCDA b) a reinforcement learning based methodology named LGTS c) there is not new method.,a) a neural network-based methodology called HMCDA,"Circular RNA (CircRNA) is a type of non-coding RNAs in which both ends are covalently linked. Researchers have demonstrated that many circRNAs can act as biomarkers of diseases. However, traditional experimental methods for circRNA-disease associations identification are labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel method based on the heterogeneous graph neural network and metapaths for circRNA-disease associations prediction termed as HMCDA. First, a heterogeneous graph consisting of circRNA-disease associations, circRNA-miRNA associations, miRNA-disease associations and disease-disease associations are constructed. Then, six metapaths are defined and generated according to the biomedical pathways. Afterwards, the entity content transformation, intra-metapath and inter-metapath aggregation are implemented to learn the embeddings of circRNA and disease entities. Finally, the learned embeddings are used to predict novel circRNA-disase associations. In particular, the result of extensive experiments demonstrates that HMCDA outperforms four state-of-the-art models in fivefold cross validation. In addition, our case study indicates that HMCDA has the ability to identify novel circRNA-disease associations."
comparative,Would the identification of rehabilitative risk factors that limit an individuals mobility improve or rather worsen the prospective treatment of affected patients?,Improve.,The identification of novel rehabilitative impairments that are risk factors for mobility limitations may improve their prevention and treatment among older adults. We tested the hypothesis that impaired rhythmic interlimb ankle and shoulder coordination are risk factors for subsequent mobility limitations among older adults.
how,How can accidents in hydropower engineering projects be avoided?,"By identifying and eliminating near misses, utilizing AI for automatic classification, and implementing association analysis for structured data mining.","Accidents of various types in the construction of hydropower engineering projects occur frequently, which leads to significant numbers of casualties and economic losses. Identifying and eliminating near misses are a significant means of preventing accidents. Mining near-miss data can provide valuable information on how to mitigate and control hazards. However, most of the data generated in the construction of hydropower engineering projects are semi-structured text data without unified standard expression, so data association analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, an artificial intelligence (AI) automatic classification method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to obtain structured data on near-miss locations and near-miss types from safety records. The apriori algorithm is used to further mine the associations between ""locations"" and ""types"" by scanning structured data. The association results are visualized using a network diagram. A Sankey diagram is used to reveal the information flow of near-miss specific objects using the ""location ⟶ type"" strong association rule. The proposed method combines text classification, association rules, and the Sankey diagrams and provides a novel approach for mining semi-structured text. Moreover, the method is proven to be useful and efficient for exploring near-miss distribution laws in hydropower engineering construction to reduce the possibility of accidents and efficiently improve the safety level of hydropower engineering construction sites."
yes/no,Is the main field of AI application in the healthcare sector focused on the individual?,Yes,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely used in the health care sector. Mainly applied for individualized care, AI is increasingly aimed at population health. This raises important ethical considerations but also calls for responsible governance, considering that this will affect the population. However, the literature points to a lack of citizen participation in the governance of AI in health. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the governance of the ethical and societal implications of AI in population health."
how,How does syntactic complexity influence speech comprehension?,"Syntactic complexity increases pupil dilations but has less impact on subjective effort, influenced more by noise level.","Speech comprehension in adverse listening conditions can be effortful even when speech is fully intelligible. Acoustical distortions typically make speech comprehension more effortful, but effort also depends on linguistic aspects of the speech signal, such as its syntactic complexity. In the present study, pupil dilations, and subjective effort ratings were recorded in 20 normal-hearing participants while performing a sentence comprehension task. The sentences were either syntactically simple (subject-first sentence structure) or complex (object-first sentence structure) and were presented in two levels of background noise both corresponding to high intelligibility. A digit span and a reading span test were used to assess individual differences in the participants' working memory capacity (WMC). The results showed that the subjectively rated effort was mostly affected by the noise level and less by syntactic complexity. Conversely, pupil dilations increased with syntactic complexity but only showed a small effect of the noise level. Participants with higher WMC showed increased pupil responses in the higher-level noise condition but rated sentence comprehension as being less effortful compared to participants with lower WMC. Overall, the results demonstrate that pupil dilations and subjectively rated effort represent different aspects of effort. Furthermore, the results indicate that effort can vary in situations with high speech intelligibility."
open-ended,Could AI be used to help disabled workers in their jobs?,"Yes, AI can assist disabled workers through technologies like N-CAPS for monitoring and support in factory assembly tasks.","This paper presents a new cognitive assistive technology, nonlinear contextually aware prompting system (N-CAPS) that uses advanced sensing and artificial intelligence to monitor and provide assistance to workers with cognitive disabilities during a factory assembly task."
factoid,What is an indirect consequence of eating a lot of meat?,"Increased meat consumption contributes to environmental degradation, worsening fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution and impacting health.","Shifting towards more meat-intensive diets may have indirect health consequences through environmental degradation. Here we examine how trends in dietary patterns in China over 1980-2010 have worsened fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) pollution, thereby inducing indirect health impacts. We show that changes in dietary composition alone, mainly by driving the rising demands for meat and animal feed, have enhanced ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions from Chinese agriculture by 63% and increased annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> by up to ~10 µg m<sup>-3</sup> (~20% of total PM<sub>2.5</sub> increase) over the period. Such effects are more than double that driven by increased food production solely due to population growth. Shifting the current diet towards a less meat-intensive recommended diet can decrease NH<sub>3</sub> emission by ~17% and PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 2-6 µg m<sup>-3</sup>, and avoid ~75,000 Chinese annual premature deaths related to PM<sub>2.5</sub>."
open-ended,What is domain adaption in the context of applying AI to medical images?,"Domain adaptation in AI for medical images refers to the process of adjusting models to account for variations in image characteristics from different sources, enhancing performance across diverse imaging environments.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of computer science that aims to implement computer systems that perform tasks that generally require human learning, reasoning, and perceptual abilities. AI is widely used in the medical field. The interpretation of medical images requires considerable effort, time, and skill. AI-aided interpretations, such as automated abnormal lesion detection and image classification, are promising areas of AI. However, when images with different characteristics are extracted, depending on the manufacturer and imaging environment, a so-called domain shift problem occurs in which the developed AI has a poor versatility. Domain adaptation is used to address this problem. Domain adaptation is a tool that generates a newly converted image which is suitable for other domains. It has also shown promise in reducing the differences in appearance among the images collected from different devices. Domain adaptation is expected to improve the reading accuracy of AI for heterogeneous image distributions in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and medical image analyses. In this paper, we review the history and basic characteristics of domain shift and domain adaptation. We also address their use in gastrointestinal endoscopy and the medical field more generally through published examples, perspectives, and future directions."
comparative,Does exposure to stress have positive or negative impact on the way they treat their children?,"Exposure to stress has a negative impact on the way mothers respond to infant cues, affecting maternal motivation, emotion regulation, and empathy.","Research shows that a woman's brain and body undergo drastic changes to support her transition to parenthood during the perinatal period. The presence of this plasticity suggests that mothers' brains may be changed by their experiences. Exposure to severe stress may disrupt adaptive changes in the maternal brain and further impact the neural circuits of stress regulation and maternal motivation. Emerging literature of human mothers provides evidence that stressful experience, whether from the past or present environment, is associated with altered responses to infant cues in brain circuits that support maternal motivation, emotion regulation, and empathy. Interventions that reduce stress levels in mothers may reverse the negative impact of stress exposure on the maternal brain. Finally, outstanding questions regarding the timing, chronicity, types, and severity of stress exposure, as well as study design to identify the causal impact of stress, and the role of race/ethnicity are discussed."
factoid,Which factors improves target mass transfer efficiency?,The vertical permeability and microvortex effect provided by the AuNP-bridge array synergistically improve target mass transfer efficiency.,"The interfacial mass transfer rate of a target has a significant impact on the sensing performance. The surface reaction forms a concentration gradient perpendicular to the surface, wherein a slow mass transfer process decreases the interfacial reaction rate. In this work, we self-assembled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the gap of a SiO<sub>2</sub> opal array to form a AuNP-bridge array. The diffusion paths of vertical permeability and a microvortex effect provided by the AuNP-bridge array synergistically improved the target mass transfer efficiency. As a proof of concept, we used DNA hybridization efficiency as a research model, and the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signal acted as a readout index. The experimental verification and theoretical simulation show that the AuNP-bridge array exhibited rapid mass transfer and high sensitivity. The DNA hybridization efficiency of the AuNP-bridge array was 15-fold higher than that of the AuNP-planar array. We believe that AuNP-bridge arrays can be potentially applied for screening drug candidates, genetic variations, and disease biomarkers."
multiple-choice,The task of automaticall sorting amomum villosum is a) not solvable b) solvable with a CNN based on x-ray data.,b) solvable with a CNN based on x-ray data.,"A machine vision system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed to sort <i>Amomum villosum</i> using X-ray non-destructive testing technology in this study. The <i>Amomum villosum</i> fruit network (AFNet) algorithm was developed to identify the internal structure for quality classification and origin identification in this manuscript. This network model is composed of experimental features of <i>Amomum villosum</i>. In this study, we adopted a binary classification method twice consecutive to identify the origin and quality of <i>Amomum villosum</i>. The results show that the accuracy, precision, and specificity of the AFNet for quality classification were 96.33%, 96.27%, and 100.0%, respectively, achieving higher accuracy than traditional CNN under the condition of faster operation speed. In addition, the model can also achieve an accuracy of 90.60% for the identification of places of origin. The accuracy of multi-category classification performed later with the consistent network structure is lower than that of the cascaded CNNs solution. With this intelligent feature recognition model, the internal structure information of <i>Amomum villosum</i> can be determined based on X-ray technology. Its application will play a positive role to improve industrial production efficiency."
hypothetical,What are persisting problems of traffic estimation?,"Data missing problem, MNAR (missing not at random) traffic speed data, link-based traffic status modeling, limited number of probe vehicles.","Even with the ubiquitous sensing data in intelligent transportation systems, such as the mobile sensing of vehicle trajectories, traffic estimation is still faced with the data missing problem due to the detector faults or limited number of probe vehicles as mobile sensors. Such data missing issue poses an obstacle for many further explorations, e.g., the link-based traffic status modeling. Although many studies have focused on tackling this kind of problem, existing studies mainly focus on the situation in which data are missing at random and ignore the distinction between links of missing data. In the practical scenario, traffic speed data are always missing not at random (MNAR). The distinction for recovering missing data on different links has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a general linear model based on probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) for solving MNAR traffic speed data imputation. Furthermore, we propose a metric, i.e., Pearson score (p-score), for distinguishing links and investigate how the model performs on links with different p-score values. Experimental results show that the new model outperforms the typically used PPCA model, and missing data on links with higher p-score values can be better recovered."
factoid,Which combination of different fields might help to overcome the severe shortcommings of models explaining human consciousness?,Combining ideas from psychology and quantum mechanics.,"Commonly accepted models of human consciousness have substantial shortcomings, in the sense that they cannot account for the entire scope of human experiences. The goal of this article is to describe a model with higher explanatory power, by integrating ideas from psychology and quantum mechanics. In the first part, the need for a paradigm change will be justified by presenting three types of phenomena that challenge the materialistic view of consciousness. The second part is about proposing an alternative view of reality and mind-matter manifestation that is able to accommodate these phenomena. Finally, the ideas from the previous parts will be combined with the psychological concepts developed by Frederic W. H. Myers. The result is a more comprehensive model of human consciousness that offers a novel perspective on altered states of consciousness, genius, and mental health."
factoid,What is foamed lightweight soil?,Lightweight cementitious material with tiny closed pores used as filler in construction.,"Foamed lightweight soil (FLS) is a lightweight cementitious material containing a large number of tiny closed pores and has been widely used as a filler in places such as railways, roads and airports. However, there has been little research into the resistance of FLS to sulphate attack in practical engineering applications. The performance of FLS against different sulphate erosion concentrations was studied to elucidate the engineering characteristics of using large volumes of FLS as fill material for the road base in the construction of intelligent networked vehicle test sites. The results showed that the compressive strength of FLS prepared using 30% Portland cement (C), 30% granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), 40% fly ash (FA) and a small amount of a concrete antiseptic agent (CA) as cementitious materials reached 0.8 and 1.9 MPa at 7 and 28 d, respectively, when the wet density was about 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which met the design requirements. The FLS prepared via the above-mentioned cementitious system had a low carbon emission, with a CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction rate of up to 70%. It also had excellent sulphate attack resistance: the corrosion resistance coefficient of the cementitious material system reached 0.97, which was considerably better than that of C (0.83). For an erosion medium environment with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations of less than 1000 mg/L (moderate), 40% GBFS or FA can be used to prepare FLS. When the concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is less than 4000 mg/L (severe), 30% C, 30% GBFS and 40% FA can be used as cementitious materials, preferably in combination with an appropriate amount of CA, to prepare FLS."
factoid,What are possible explanations for the negative correlation between religiousness and aggression?,"1. Teaching self-control
2. Emphasizing compassionate beliefs","Although people have used religion to justify aggression, evidence suggests that greater religiousness corresponds with less aggression. We explored two explanations for the religion-aggression link. First, most major religions teach self-control (e.g., delaying gratification, resisting temptation), which diminishes aggression. Second, most major religions emphasize compassionate beliefs and behavior (i.e., perspective taking, forgiveness, a broader love of humanity) that are incompatible with aggression. We tested whether self-control and compassion mediated the relationship between religion and aggression (direct and indirect) in a longitudinal study of 1,040 adolescents in the United States. Structural equation analyses revealed that self-control and compassion together completely mediated the religion-aggression relationship for both types of aggression."
open-ended,What is the reason that the universe will die?,The paper does not provide specific details on why the universe will die.,"The death of our universe is as certain as our individual death. Some cosmologists have elaborated models which would make the cosmos immortal. In this paper, I examine them as cosmological extrapolations of immortality narratives that civilizations have developed to face death anxiety. I first show why cosmological death should be a worry, then I briefly examine scenarios involving the notion of soul or resurrection on a cosmological scale. I discuss in how far an intelligent civilization could stay alive by engaging in stellar, galactic and universal rejuvenation. Finally, I argue that leaving a cosmological legacy via universe making is an inspiring and promising narrative to achieve cosmological immortality."
comparative,Would a motivational model of psychopathology be better if it would integrate information about the bottom-up emotion generation system with top-down emotion regulation systems?,Yes,"Motivational models of psychopathology have long been advanced by psychophysiologists, and have provided key insights into neurobiological mechanisms of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. These accounts emphasize individual differences in activity and reactivity of bottom-up, subcortical neural systems of approach and avoidance in affecting behavior. Largely independent literatures emphasize the roles of top-down, cortical deficits in emotion regulation and executive function in conferring vulnerability to psychopathology. To date however, few models effectively integrate functions performed by bottom-up emotion generation system with those performed by top-down emotion regulation systems in accounting for alternative expressions of psychopathology. In this article, we present such a model, and describe how it accommodates the well replicated bifactor structure of psychopathology. We describe how excessive approach motivation maps directly into externalizing liability, how excessive passive avoidance motivation maps directly into internalizing liability, and how emotion dysregulation and executive function map onto general liability. This approach is consistent with the Research Domain Criteria initiative, which assumes that a limited number of brain systems interact to confer vulnerability to many if not most forms of psychopathology."
open-ended,What influences in individuals capacity to be innovative?,"Persistence, motor diversity, activity, and neophobia.","Innovation is widely linked to cognitive ability, brain size, and adaptation to novel conditions. However, successful innovation appears to be influenced by both cognitive factors, such as inhibitory control, and non-cognitive behavioral traits. We used a multi-access box (MAB) paradigm to measure repeated innovation, the number of unique innovations learned across trials, by 10 captive spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Spotted hyenas are highly innovative in captivity and also display striking variation in behavioral traits, making them good model organisms for examining the relationship between innovation and other behavioral traits. We measured persistence, motor diversity, motivation, activity, efficiency, inhibitory control, and neophobia demonstrated by hyenas while interacting with the MAB. We also independently assessed inhibitory control with a detour cylinder task. Most hyenas were able to solve the MAB at least once, but only four hyenas satisfied learning criteria for all four possible solutions. Interestingly, neither measure of inhibitory control predicted repeated innovation. Instead, repeated innovation was predicted by a proactive syndrome of behavioral traits that included high persistence, high motor diversity, high activity and low neophobia. Our results suggest that this proactive behavioral syndrome may be more important than inhibitory control for successful innovation with the MAB by members of this species."
descriptive,What is a possibility for curing cervical cancer?,Early detection of pre-cancerous cervical changes through advanced screening technologies.,"Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Detection of pre-cancerous cervical changes provides a window of opportunity for cure of an otherwise lethal disease when metastatic. With a greater understanding of the biology and natural course of high-risk HPV infections, screening methods have shifted beyond subjective Pap smears toward more sophisticated and objective tactics. This has led to a substantial growth in the breadth and depth of HPV-based cervical cancer screening tests, especially in developed countries without constrained resources. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have less access to advanced laboratories and healthcare resources, so new point-of-care (POC) technologies have been developed to provide test results in real time, improve the efficiency of techniques, and increase screening adoption. In this Review, we will discuss how novel decentralized screening technologies and computational strategies improve upon traditional methods and how their realized promise could further democratize cervical cancer screening and promote greater disease prevention."
how,How does punishment influence inter-brain synchronization between two individuals?,"Punishment has a negative effect on inter-brain synchronization, reducing it in social interactions.","Punishment is a popular institution to enforce social norms in human society. However, how the punishment institution impacts the inter-brain neural signatures of two-person social interactions is still an open question. By performing electroencephalography recording of brain activity in two interacting parties as they simultaneously played both the revised repeated ultimatum game (rrUG) and the revised repeated dictator game (rrDG), this study focused on exploring how the introduction of external punishment influences inter-brain synchronization between the two parties. The data showed a significant negative effect of external punishment on inter-brain synchronization, with greater inter-brain synchronization observed in the rrDG than in the rrUG. We proposed a possible mechanism underlying this result. In the rrDG, the similar moral motivation of both proposers and responders results in inter-brain synchronization between them. However, in the rrUG, the introduction of external punishment crowds out the intrinsic moral motivation of the proposers, thereby undermining the inter-brain synchronization. Moreover, we found a significant positive correlation between the rejection rate from responders for disadvantageous inequal offer and inter-brain synchronization in the rrDG. These findings contribute to understanding the negative effect of punishment institution and shed light on the inter-brain mechanism underlying social interaction."
hypothetical,Can it be dangerous for a person with only one kidney if it gets infected with Covid?,"Yes, potential danger exists; SARS-CoV-2 can induce renal damage, and ACE2, critical for kidney function, is implicated.","Studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 can directly target the kidney and induce renal damage. As the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role for renal physiology and function. Thus, it is important to understand ACE2 through which pathway influences the pathogenesis of renal damage induced by COVID-19. In this study, we first performed an eQTL mapping for Ace2 in kidney tissues in 53 BXD mice strains. Results demonstrated that Ace2 is highly expressed and strongly controlled by a genetic locus on chromosome 16 in the kidney, with six genes (Dnase1, Vasn, Usp7, Abat, Mgrn1, and Rbfox1) dominated as the upstream modulator, as they are highly correlated with Ace2 expression. Gene co-expression analysis showed that Ace2 co-variates are significantly involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway which acts as a reno-protector. Importantly, we also found that Ace2 is positively correlated with Pdgf family members, particularly Pdgfc, which showed the most association among the 76 investigated growth factors. Mammalian Phenotype Ontology enrichment indicated that the cognate transcripts for both Ace2 and Pdgfc were mainly involved in regulating renal physiology and morphology. Among which, Cd44, Egfr, Met, Smad3, and Stat3 were identified as hub genes through protein-protein interaction analysis. Finally, in aligning with our systems genetics findings, we found ACE2, pdgf family members, and RAS genes decreased significantly in the CAKI-1 kidney cancer cells treated with S protein and receptor binding domain structural protein. Collectively, our data suggested that ACE2 work with RAS, PDGFC, as well as their cognate hub genes to regulate renal function, which could guide for future clinical prevention and targeted treatment for COVID-19-induced renal damage outcomes. KEY MESSAGES: • Ace2 is highly expressed and strongly controlled by a genetic locus on chromosome 16 in the kidney. • Ace2 co-variates are enriched in the RAS pathway. • Ace2 is strongly correlated with the growth factor Pdgfc. • Ace2 and Pdgfc co-expressed genes involved in the regulation of renal physiology and morphology. • SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein induces down-regulation of Ace2, RAS, and Pdgfc."
factoid,Which criteria do modern language models such as GPT 3.5 not meet in order to be applicable in childcare?,"They failed to meet passing criteria in Japan's childcare worker national examination, and accuracy concerns were observed, posing a risk of incorrect information.","Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the performance and acceptance of responses generated by ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to Japanese childcare-related questions to assess their potential applicability and limitations in the childcare field, specifically focusing on the accuracy, usefulness, and empathy of the generated answers. Methods We evaluated answers in Japanese generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for two types of childcare-related questions. ① For the written examination questions of Japan's childcare worker national examination for 2023's fiscal year, we calculated the correct answer rates using official answers. ② We selected one question from each of the seven categories from the child-rearing questions posted on the Japanese National Childcare Workers Association's website and had GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 generate answers. These were evaluated alongside existing childcare worker answers by human professionals. Five childcare workers then blindly selected what they considered the best answer among the three and rated them on a five-point scale for 'accuracy,' 'usefulness,' and 'empathy.' Results In the examination consisting of 160 written questions, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 produced responses to all 155 questions, excluding four questions omitted due to copyright concerns and one question deemed invalid due to inherent flaws in the question itself, with correct answer rates of 30.3% for GPT-3.5 and 47.7% for GPT-4 (p<0.01). For the child-rearing Q&A questions, childcare worker answers by human professionals were chosen as the best answer most frequently (45.7%), followed by GPT-3.5 (31.4%) and GPT-4 (22.9%). While GPT-3.5 received the highest average rating for accuracy (3.69 points), childcare worker answers by human professionals received the highest average ratings for usefulness and empathy (both 3.57 points). Conclusions Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 failed to meet the passing criteria in Japan's childcare worker national examination, and for the child-rearing questions, GPT-3.5 was rated higher in accuracy despite lower correct answer rates. Over half of the childcare workers considered the ChatGPT-generated answers to be the best ones, yet concerns about accuracy were observed, highlighting the potential risk of incorrect information in the Japanese context."
how,How can potentiated Natural Killer cells help to cure ccRCC?,"Potentiated Natural Killer (NK) cells enhance cytotoxicity against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells, contributing to inhibition of ccRCC progression.","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common and lethal types of urologic cancer. With low survival rates among patients in advanced stages of disease, and increasing rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide, novel therapeutic targets for ccRCC clinical intervention are necessary. In this study, we investigated the functional role of circZKSCAN1 in ccRCC progression. Our results suggested that circZKSCAN1 was abundantly expressed in ccRCC tumor tissues and cells. CircZKSCAN1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells, whereas potentiated Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity against RCC cells <i>in vitro</i> and repressed tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, we identified a novel circZKSCAN1/miR-1294/PIM1 axis was identified in RCC progression, showing that the expression of circZKSCAN1 expression in RCC cells was transcriptionally regulated by Kruppel-like factor 2.

comparative,Do people generally score higher in general health measurements when they get older?,GPT gave a wrong answer,"This study investigated the change in the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) scores from teenage years to young adulthood using a large, nationally representative sample in the UK. It took account of socio-demographic variables, childhood intelligence, behavioural problems and self-esteem at teenage and educational qualifications in early adulthood. In total, 3942 cohort members had the complete data on GHQ at ages 16 and 30 years. T-tests showed that there was statistically significant increase of GHQ mean scores over the 14 years (p < .001), however at the item level there were changes in both directions. The analysis showed that over 14 years the test-retest correlation was r = 0.24, indicating a modest level of stability. The GHQ was significantly and negatively associated with self-esteem, and positively associated with childhood behavioural problems. Regression analysis showed that gender, self-esteem, and behavioural problems measured in the teenage years were all significant predictors of GHQ at both time points, indicating the long-term effects of psychological and behavioural factors on teenagers and young adults' mental health outcome. The implications for early interventions in school and family settings are discussed."
open-ended,Are there possible genetic causes for bipolar disorder?,"Yes, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic loci associated with bipolar disorder (BD), suggesting possible genetic causes.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported substantial genomic loci significantly associated with clinical risk of bipolar disorder (BD), and studies combining techniques of genetics, neuroscience, neuroimaging, and pharmacology are believed to help tackle clinical problems (e.g., identifying novel therapeutic targets). However, translating findings of psychiatric genetics into biological mechanisms underlying BD pathogenesis remains less successful. Biological impacts of majority of BD GWAS risk loci are obscure, and the involvement of many GWAS risk genes in this illness is yet to be investigated. It is thus necessary to review the progress of applying BD GWAS risk genes in the research and intervention of the disorder. A comprehensive literature search found that a number of such risk genes had been investigated in cellular or animal models, even before they were highlighted in BD GWAS. Intriguingly, manipulation of many BD risk genes (e.g., ANK3, CACNA1C, CACNA1B, HOMER1, KCNB1, MCHR1, NCAN, SHANK2 etc.) resulted in altered murine behaviors largely restoring BD clinical manifestations, including mania-like symptoms such as hyperactivity, anxiolytic-like behavior, as well as antidepressant-like behavior, and these abnormalities could be attenuated by mood stabilizers. In addition to recapitulating phenotypic characteristics of BD, some GWAS risk genes further provided clues for the neurobiology of this illness, such as aberrant activation and functional connectivity of brain areas in the limbic system, and modulated dendritic spine morphogenesis as well as synaptic plasticity and transmission. Therefore, BD GWAS risk genes are undoubtedly pivotal resources for modeling this illness, and might be translational therapeutic targets in the future clinical management of BD. We discuss both promising prospects and cautions in utilizing the bulk of useful resources generated by GWAS studies. Systematic integrations of findings from genetic and neuroscience studies are called for to promote our understanding and intervention of BD."
how,How can the effects of Kratom Mitragyna speciosa be described?,The effects of Kratom Mitragyna speciosa are opioid-like.,"Kratom or Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.) is a medicinal plant of Southeast Asia. As a result of its opioid-like effects, it remains unknown whether consumption of kratom tea is associated with impaired cognitive function. We assessed the cognitive function of 70 regular kratom users and 25 control participants using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Participants performed six neuropsychological tasks that assessed motor, learning and memory, attention and executive function. Relative to control participants, higher consumption (>3 glasses daily or mitragynine doses between 72.5 mg and 74.9 mg) of kratom tea was selectively associated with impaired performance on the Paired Associates Learning task, reflecting deficits in visual episodic memory and new learning. Overall, the performance of kratom users compared to control participants, and the performance of high (>3 glasses per day) as well as low (≤3 glasses per day) kratom using groups, were comparable on all neuropsychological domains. Higher intake of kratom juice (>3 glasses daily) did not appear to impair motor, memory, attention or executive function of regular kratom users."
factoid,What brain-related abnormalies can be observed among autistic children?,"Abnormalities in brain connections, especially in the left hemisphere, and connectivity issues in frontal and parietal lobes are observed in autistic children, with significant differences in alpha, beta, and gamma bands.","In neuropsychological disorders, the significant abnormalities in the brain connections in some regions are observed. This paper presents a novel model to demonstrate the connections between different regions in children with autism. The proposed model first conducts the wavelet decomposition of electroencephalography signals by wavelet transform then the features are extracted, such as relative energy and entropy. These features are fed to the 3D-cellular neural network model as inputs to indicate the brain connections. The results showed that there are significant differences and abnormalities in the left hemisphere, (p<0.05) at the electrodes AF3, F3, P7, T7 and O1 in alpha band, AF3, F7, T7 and O1 in beta band, T7 and P7 in gamma band for children with autism compared with the control children. Also, the evaluation of the obtained connections values between brain regions indicated that there are more abnormalities in the connectivity of frontal and parietal lobes and the relations of the neighboring regions in all three bands especially in gamma band for autistic children. Evaluation of the analysis demonstrated that alpha frequency band had the best distinction level of 96.6% based on the obtained values of the cellular neural network using support vector machine method."
yes/no,Can traditional MFS algorithms be outperformed with other alternatives?,"Yes, the proposed OSLGC method outperforms traditional Multi-Label Feature Selection (MFS) algorithms.","Multi-label streaming feature selection has received widespread attention in recent years because the dynamic acquisition of features is more in line with the needs of practical application scenarios. Most previous methods either assume that the labels are independent of each other, or, although label correlation is explored, the relationship between related labels and features is difficult to understand or specify. In real applications, both situations may occur where the labels are correlated and the features may belong specifically to some labels. Moreover, these methods treat features individually without considering the interaction between features. Based on this, we present a novel online streaming feature selection method based on label group correlation and feature interaction (OSLGC). In our design, we first divide labels into multiple groups with the help of graph theory. Then, we integrate label weight and mutual information to accurately quantify the relationships between features under different label groups. Subsequently, a novel feature selection framework using sliding windows is designed, including online feature relevance analysis and online feature interaction analysis. Experiments on ten datasets show that the proposed method outperforms some mature MFS algorithms in terms of predictive performance, statistical analysis, stability analysis, and ablation experiments."
yes/no,Is the blood brain barrier important for the ability of people to smell cheese?,"No, the context provided does not mention any connection between the blood-brain barrier and the ability to smell cheese.","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an essential structure for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Alterations to the BBB are linked with a myriad of pathological conditions and play a significant role in the onset and evolution of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Thus, a deeper understanding of the BBB's structure and function is mandatory for a better knowledge of neurodegenerative disorders and the development of effective therapies. Because studying the BBB in vivo imposes overwhelming difficulties, the in vitro approach remains the main possible way of research. With many in vitro BBB models having been developed over the last years, the main aim of this review is to systematically present the most relevant designs used in neurological research. In the first part of the article, the physiological and structural-functional parameters of the human BBB are detailed. Subsequently, available BBB models are presented in a comparative approach, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Finally, the new perspectives related to the study of Alzheimer's disease with the help of novel devices that mimic the in vivo human BBB milieu gives the paper significant originality."

yes/no,Are expecially native new zealanders affected by rheumatic fever?,Yes,Acute rheumatic fever in New Zealand persists and is a barometer of equity as its burden almost exclusively falls on Māori and Pacific Island populations. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether an incentive programme will result in increased secondary prophylaxis injections over a one-year period compared to a baseline period prior to the intervention.
factoid,Assume you have motivated and not so motivated people in your study. Which group of participants are more likely to exhibit a greater placebo response?,Motivated participants.,"Drawing upon research in perception and motivation, the current study proposes a motivation-attention model of placebo in which more motivated persons pay greater attention to placebo-related stimuli, directly influencing placebo response. We manipulated both motivation to respond to placebo and expectations of placebo response in a 2 × 2 design. Participants (N = 152) evaluated a series of placebo pheromones (slightly scented water) of potential romantic dates and made desirability ratings. Consistent with hypotheses, more highly motivated participants demonstrated greater placebo responses, as evidenced by higher desirability ratings of the ""pheromone"" and greater variability among ratings, when compared to less motivated participants. Moreover, the relation between motivation and placebo response was mediated by attention. Contrary to expectations, we found no effect for expectancy. These findings highlight the importance of motivation and the mediating factor of attention in placebo and support goal-oriented models of placebo."
factoid,Which aspects the paper about deep reconstruction models for image set classification has been criticised by other researchers?,Experimental results and data inconsistencies.,"We comment on a paper describing an algorithm for image set classification. Following the general practice in computer vision research, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated on benchmarks in order to support the claim of its advantage over other algorithms in the literature. We have examined the reported data of experiences on two datasets, and found that many numbers are not a possible answer regardless how the random partitions were selected and regardless how the algorithms performed in each partition. Our finding suggests that the experimental results in the paper (""Deep Reconstruction Models for Image Set Classification"", IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 37, no. 4, pp. 713-727, April 2015) has serious flaws to the extent that all the experimental results should be re-examined."
yes/no,Are colloid cysts ronly elated to neurocognitive decline after a patient has been operated?,Yes.,"Colloid cysts (CC) have been associated with neurocognitive function (NCF) decline, both preoperatively and after resection. Factors such as local pressure on the fornix and hydrocephalus are thought to contribute to preoperative NCF decline. The potential cause of postoperative decline is thought to be forniceal injury during surgery. In the current series, we describe NCF outcomes amongst patients with CC, both nonoperated and operated."
yes/no,Can machine learning models predict individuals that are likely to again sicken with intracerebral hemorrhage?,Yes.,"We aimed to develop and validate an objective and easy-to-use model for identifying patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who have a poor 90-day prognosis. This three-center retrospective study included a large cohort of 1,122 patients with ICH who presented within 6 h of symptom onset [training cohort, <i>n</i> = 835; internal validation cohort, <i>n</i> = 201; external validation cohort (center 2 and 3), <i>n</i> = 86]. We collected the patients' baseline clinical, radiological, and laboratory data as well as the 90-day functional outcomes. Independent risk factors for prognosis were identified through univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A nomogram was developed to visualize the model results while a calibration curve was used to verify whether the predictive performance was satisfactorily consistent with the ideal curve. Finally, we used decision curves to assess the clinical utility of the model. At 90 days, 714 (63.6%) patients had a poor prognosis. Factors associated with prognosis included age, midline shift, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), hypodensities, ICH volume, perihematomal edema (PHE) volume, temperature, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, age, ICH volume, and GCS were identified as independent risk factors for prognosis. For identifying patients with poor prognosis, the model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.874, 0.822, and 0.868 in the training cohort, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curve revealed that the nomogram showed satisfactory calibration in the training and validation cohorts. Decision curve analysis showed the clinical utility of the nomogram. Taken together, the nomogram developed in this study could facilitate the individualized outcome prediction in patients with ICH."
hypothetical,How could Endoplasmic reticulum stress be measured?,"Through the detection of morphological patterns, particularly the formation of ring-shaped structures called whorls (WHs), using a deep learning-based image analysis assay named ER-WHs-Analyzer.","Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) is a condition that is defined by abnormal accumulation of unfolded proteins. It plays an important role in maintaining cellular protein, lipid, and ion homeostasis. By triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR) under ER stress, cells restore homeostasis or undergo apoptosis. Chronic ER stress is implicated in many human diseases. Despite extensive studies on related signaling mechanisms, reliable image biomarkers for ER stress remain lacking. To address this deficiency, we have validated a morphological image biomarker for ER stress and have developed a deep learning-based assay to enable automated detection and analysis of this marker for screening studies. Specifically, ER under stress exhibits abnormal morphological patterns that feature ring-shaped structures called whorls (WHs). Using a highly specific chemical probe for unfolded and aggregated proteins, we find that formation of ER whorls is specifically associated with the accumulation of the unfolded and aggregated proteins. This confirms that ER whorls can be used as an image biomarker for ER stress. To this end, we have developed ER-WHs-Analyzer, a deep learning-based image analysis assay that automatically recognizes and localizes ER whorls similarly as human experts. It does not require laborious manual annotation of ER whorls for training of deep learning models. Importantly, it reliably classifies different patterns of ER whorls induced by different ER stress drugs. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insights into morphological patterns of ER under stress as well as an image biomarker assay for screening studies to dissect related disease mechanisms and to accelerate related drug discoveries. It demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in recognizing and understanding complex morphological phenotypes of ER."
comparative,is it easier to experimentally determine or  to computationally predict their an RNA's structure?,It is easier to computationally predict an RNA's structure than experimentally determine it.,"RNA is a unique biomolecule that is involved in a variety of fundamental biological functions, all of which depend solely on its structure and dynamics. Since the experimental determination of crystal RNA structures is laborious, computational 3D structure prediction methods are experiencing an ongoing and thriving development. Such methods can lead to many models; thus, it is necessary to build comparisons and extract common structural motifs for further medical or biological studies. Here, we introduce a computational pipeline dedicated to reference-free high-throughput comparative analysis of 3D RNA structures. We show its application in the RNA-Puzzles challenge, in which five participating groups attempted to predict the three-dimensional structures of 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report the results of this puzzle and discuss the structural motifs obtained from the analysis. All simulated models and tools incorporated into the pipeline are open to scientific and academic use."
comparative,Is there a faster growing type of genomics data than the single-cell omics?,No.,"Single-cell omics is the fastest-growing type of genomics data in the literature and public genomics repositories. Leveraging the growing repository of labeled datasets and transferring labels from existing datasets to newly generated datasets will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the intrinsic heterogeneity among cell populations and extrinsic differences between datasets. Here, we present a robust graph artificial intelligence model, single-cell Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN), to achieve effective knowledge transfer across disparate datasets. Through benchmarking with other label transfer methods on a total of 30 single cell omics datasets, scGCN consistently demonstrates superior accuracy on leveraging cells from different tissues, platforms, and species, as well as cells profiled at different molecular layers. scGCN is implemented as an integrated workflow as a python software, which is available at https://github.com/QSong-github/scGCN ."
multiple-choice,Which of the following criteria are included in clinically assessing dementia: a) body smell b) hairstyle c) body size d) previous employment e) depressive symptoms,e) depressive symptoms,"Diagnostic assessments for dementia include the evaluation of subjective memory impairment, dementia worries, or depressive symptoms. Data on the predictive value of these factors remain unclear, and varying help-seeking behavior may contribute to this finding. We investigate whether differentiating help-seeking motivation from other psychological factors associated with cognitive impairment would enhance the prediction of diagnostic outcomes in a memory clinic. We obtained information on help-seeking motivation from 171 patients who underwent routine diagnostic assessments. Utilizing a discriminant correspondence analysis, our results indicate that extrinsic motivation increases the likelihood of receiving a dementia diagnosis, whereas depression or the duration of deficits carries discriminatory information to further guide the differentiation of prodromal dementia. Recognizing motivational aspects of help-seeking behavior can complement the clinical evaluation of cognitive performance."
descriptive,Can you describe an environment in which cochlear implants do not function properly?,Noisy environments,"Temporal envelope cues are conveyed by cochlear implants (CIs) to hearing loss patients to restore hearing. Although CIs could enable users to communicate in clear listening environments, noisy environments still pose a problem. To improve speech-processing strategies used in Chinese CIs, we explored the relative contributions made by the temporal envelope in various frequency regions, as relevant to Mandarin sentence recognition in noise."
multiple-choice,What are dual-mechanism ECL sensors based on? a) measuring the amount of calcium in water for electrocatalytic activity b) RET by assembling GNPs on 2d polymorphyrinic MOF nanosheets.,b) RET by assembling GNPs on 2D polymorphyrinic MOF nanosheets.,"A dual-mechanism-driven ratiometric electrochemiluminescent (ECL) biosensor was developed for the ultrasensitive detection of protein kinase activity, which was based on a competitive catalytic reaction and resonance energy transfer (RET) by assembling gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on two-dimensional (2D) porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets. In this work, an ECL catalytic reaction competing for dissolved O<sub>2</sub> proceeded between 2D copper-based zinc porphyrinic MOF (Cu-TCPP(Zn)) nanosheets and luminol. Meanwhile, the cathodic ECL of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), derived from the electrocatalytic reaction of 2D Cu-TCPP(Zn), would be reduced by the assembled GNPs due to RET, while the anodic emission of luminol could be enhanced by GNPs with excellent electrocatalytic activity. With the detection of protein kinase A (PKA) as an example, this dual-mechanism-driven ECL biosensor exhibited a broad linear range (0.005-5.0 U mL<sup>-1</sup>) and a sensitive detection limit (0.0037 U mL<sup>-1</sup>). Compared with the traditional single-mechanism-driven sensing strategies, the developed dual-mechanism-driven ratiometric ECL biosensor may provide an effective method for the design of green and ultrasensitive ECL sensors."
