## Introduction

Although being pretrained on a vast corpus of data, Large Language Models (LLMs) applied for Q&A applications face severe challenges when being confronted with out-of-scope user requests. Especially in highly sensitive domains, such as the medical domain, sharing data with companies that have the resources to train these models is oftentimes not an option. Retrieval augmented generation systems can lead out of this pitfall by providing a way, to use the power of LLMs on one's data without sharing it.
The purpose of this project was to create such a system based on 190k scientific abstracts from the Pubmed database, to test and evaluate the possibility of creating  a privacy-preserving, question-answering application that meets the high standards required in the medical domain.

## Related Work

## Methods/Approach

Provide conceptual details of the system, including data processing pipelines, algorithms, and key methods. Be specific about methods, and include equations and figures where necessary. Clearly distinguish original contributions from existing methods.

## Experimental Setup and Results

### Data
Describe the dataset, including its source, collection method, and any insightful metrics.

### Evaluation Method
Define the evaluation metric used, whether existing or self-defined. Motivate the choice and clarify what it reflects.

### Experimental Details
Specify configurable parameters, explaining their choice and any optimization methods used.

### Results
Present results using tables and plots, comparing against baselines if available. Comment on results and analyze their alignment with expectations.

### Analysis
Include qualitative analysis. Discuss system performance in different contexts and compare with baselines.

## Conclusion and Future Work
