## Branch Structure
1. Main - contains the latest working version of the project.
2. Dev - contains the current version in development.
3. Dev_initials - contains a copy of the dev branch (to be updated regularly from DEV) on which each individual is working.

Branching hierarchy:
Development is done in Dev_initials.
If a new feature or something similar is completed, it is merged into Dev.
Everytime an individual merges something into Dev another has to confirm the merge.
Only working components that do not break the functionality of the Dev branch will be merged.
Once we reached another milestone all of it will be merged into Main.

So the structure is:
Dev_initials -> Dev -> Main

How to write a commit: 
1. Write all authors/contributers of the commit in brackets e.g: 
"[Name 1, Name 2] <this is a commit message>"
